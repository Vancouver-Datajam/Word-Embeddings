The prime minister has said he wants to be honest about the "costs and trade-offs" of tackling climate change.In a statement on Tuesday, Rishi Sunak said he was proud that "Britain is leading the world on climate change", and will stick by the agreements the UK has made internationally.But he then overhauled measures designed to meet these targets.So, is the UK really a world leader on emissions cuts, and how will the changes the PM announced  affect its efforts?Mr Sunak said the government was still "completely committed" to the 2050 net zero target which his predecessor, Theresa May, made law back in 2019.Net zero means a country does not add any additional greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."This country is proud to be a world leader in reaching net zero by 2050. But we simply won't achieve it unless we change. We'll now have a more pragmatic, proportionate, and realistic approach that eases the burdens on families," he said.It is true the UK has been successful in cutting emissions compared to other countries.Since 1990, emissions within the UK have fallen by 48.7% up to the end of 2022 - excluding international aviation and shipping - according to government data.These cuts are greater than other countries in the G7 (Group of Seven), an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called "advanced" economies - although Germany has reduced its emissions at a faster rate compared with the UK since 2015.But the cuts the UK has made so far are - arguably - the easiest ones.One of the main ways they have been achieved is by switching away from fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to generate electricity.Emissions from electricity generation have fallen by around three-quarters since 1990, while the proportion of electricity generated by renewables - like wind and solar - has soared.The government has bold plans to continue this "decarbonisation" process.But achieving net zero means cutting emissions across all sectors of the economy.That is why there are targets for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles and switching from gas boilers to heat pumps or other low-carbon alternatives to heat our homes.And, despite the UK's achievements on climate so far, there have been a number of warnings that progress is beginning to falter. These came even before today's announcement.Earlier this year, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) - the government's independent advisers on cutting carbon emissions - warned that the UK's efforts to meet its net zero commitments were already "worryingly slow".It also said it was "markedly less confident" than a year earlier that it would meet its 2030 and 2035 emissions reduction targets.Similar warnings on electricity have come from the National Audit Office and a cross-party group of MPs.But contrary to these findings, Mr Sunak claimed in his announcement that the UK was "on track" to meet its commitments.He also announced a substantial increase in the subsidies available to people who want to install heat pumps to heat their home, with the grant increased by 50% to £7,500.The CCC says it was not consulted ahead of the announcement, and needed to do the full calculations before determining the carbon cost.But the changes certainly seem to make the current targets much harder to achieve - as any extra carbon costs would have to be balanced by extra savings in other areas. And how much carbon the UK can use in coming years has already been set down in carbon budgets."Today's announcement is likely to take the UK further away from being able to meet its legal commitments," said Piers Forster, the CCC's chair."This, coupled with the recent unsuccessful offshore wind auction, gives us concern," and "more action is needed," he added."What's depressing about all the changes [the PM] has told us about is they all go in the same direction," Prof Miles Allen of the University of Oxford told the BBC."If we do everything slower, we're just going to make it more difficult to reach that target," he said.One of the most eye-catching changes is delaying the 2030 ban on sales of new, fully petrol and diesel cars, announced by Mr Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson.Despite what's often assumed, electric car sales are actually surging. In 2022, nearly 17% of new car sales were battery electric - ahead of the CCC's schedule and up from less than 2% in 2019.Some in the car industry have warned that delaying the ban on new petrol and diesel cars could hit investment and therefore electric vehicle sales.Achieving the 2030 phase-out of new fully petrol and diesel car and van sales is "vital to meeting the UK's decarbonisation pathway", the CCC warned in June.But Mr Sunak says it should be the consumer who decides whether or not to buy an electric car and not "government forcing you to do it". He also says the new plan is in line with countries including Germany, France, Spain and Canada.Mr Sunak says his review of the government's green pledges is all about putting the "long-term interests of our country before the short-term political needs of the moment."He said "some of the things that were being proposed would have cost typical families upwards of five, ten, fifteen thousand pounds".But the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) - an independent climate change think tank - points out that nobody is being forced to take up these measures right now.For example, the planned ban on the sale of new gas boilers was due to start in 2035 for all households. It is only relevant when your boiler breaks or you choose to switch.It is a similar story with cars.  Four out of five of us buy second-hand cars - for which there is no phase-out date - and older cars can continue to be driven after 2030.The 20% of people who can afford to buy a new car already had six years until they would have had to choose between fully electric vehicles and hybrids - which can be filled up with petrol. Now they have 11 years.The changes to net zero policy "will add to the cost of living for those struggling, not make things easier", argues Peter Chalkley, a director of the ECIU.And an analysis by the ECIU suggests the PM's announcements could cost British households almost £8bn in higher bills over the next decade - and more if gas prices spike again - due to cancelling new energy efficiency regulations for the private rental sector.The CCC has estimated that meeting the legally binding 2050 goal will require an extra £50bn of investment every year by 2030.It said that once the savings from reduced use of fossil fuels are factored in, the overall resource cost of the transition to net zero is less than 1% of GDP over the next 30 years. By 2044 it should become cost-saving, the CCC said, as newer cleaner technologies are more efficient than those they are replacing.Many scientists have pointed out to the BBC that delaying investment simply increases the ultimate cost.And of course, the global costs of climate inaction would be much higher, as the world would be hit by increasingly damaging climate impacts.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Climate change played major role in Libya floods
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66854670
Content:
Climate change made the storm that devastated the Libyan city of Derna, killing thousands of people, up to 50 times more likely, experts say.Up to 50% more rain had fallen as a result of human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, climate scientists at the World Weather Attribution group found.Years of conflict in the region compounded the vulnerability of people to flooding, the WWA report says.And it turned the extreme weather into a full-scale humanitarian disaster.The scientists used computer simulations to assess how much more likely such a storm was now compared with before the 1.1C of warming climate change has already brought.But they cautioned a lack of data, particularly in Libya, meant considerable uncertainties in their findings.Storm Daniel, which brought the deadly rains, had already dumped 910mm (35in) of rain on parts of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, killing 28 people.And the study found climate change had made this up to 10 times more likely, bringing up to 40% more rain.Storms of this intensity are now reasonably common for this region and can be expected once every 10 years, it warns.But the weather event in northern Libya was much more exceptional, bringing a storm of an intensity such as would be expected to hit northern Libya once every 300-600 years.As Storm Daniel travelled slowly over the Mediterranean, it drew additional energy from sea temperatures two to three degrees above the September average."Storm Daniel was [a] low pressure [weather system], as we usually have in the Mediterranean," Kostas Lagouvardos, from the National Observatory of Athens, says. "It was not very deep - but it was very early in the season and it was stagnant and stayed over the south Ionian Sea for four, five days."That extra warmth fuelled stronger winds and meant the air could hold more moisture.And when it hit the northern coast of Libya, it dumped an estimated 400mm of rain on Derna in just 24 hours.The average for September in the city is just 1.5mm, according to Nasa's Earth Observatory.The huge impact shows how intense weather can combine with a vulnerable population with disastrous consequences, the scientists say.In Libya, the ousting of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011, was followed by political instability and civil war.Two dams in the river above Derna were old and poorly maintained. Many houses had been built on the flood-plain. And when they burst, tens of millions of cubic metres of water poured into the city, sweeping away entire neighbourhoods.The scientists warned their findings had large mathematical uncertainties, as:"After a summer of devastating heatwaves and wildfires with a very clear climate-change fingerprint, quantifying the contribution of global warming to these floods proved more challenging," one of the study's authors, Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, said."While we have some weather station data over Greece, we don't have any weather station data over Libya."Instead, the scientists had to rely on data based on satellite readings.But they are confident climate change played a significant role, because there is very strong evidence higher temperatures lead to heavier rainfall and other studies have shown climate change increases the intensity of weather systems such as Storm Daniel.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Antarctic ice at 'mind-blowing' low alarms experts
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66724246
Content:
The sea-ice surrounding Antarctica is well below any previous recorded winter level, satellite data shows, a worrying new benchmark for a region that once seemed resistant to global warming."It's so far outside anything we've seen, it's almost mind-blowing," says Walter Meier, who monitors sea-ice with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.An unstable Antarctica could have far-reaching consequences, polar experts warn.Antarctica's huge ice expanse regulates the planet's temperature, as the white surface reflects the Sun's energy back into the atmosphere and also cools the water beneath and near it.Without its ice cooling the planet, Antarctica could transform from Earth's refrigerator to a radiator, experts say.The ice that floats on the Antarctic Ocean's surface now measures less than 17 million sq km - that is 1.5 million sq km of sea-ice less than the September average, and well below previous winter record lows.That's an area of missing ice about five times the size of the British Isles.Dr Meier is not optimistic that the sea-ice will recover to a significant degree.Scientists are still trying to identify all the factors that led to this year's low sea-ice - but studying trends in Antarctica has historically been challenging.In a year when several global heat and ocean temperature records have broken, some scientists insist the low sea-ice is the measure to pay attention to."We can see how much more vulnerable it is," says Dr Robbie Mallett, of the University of Manitoba, who is based on the Antarctic peninsula.Already braving isolation, extreme cold and powerful winds, this year's thin sea-ice has made his team's work even more difficult. "There is a risk that it breaks off and drifts out to sea with us on it," Dr Mallett says.Sea-ice forms in the continent's winter (March to October) before largely melting in summer, and is part of an interconnected system that also consists of icebergs, land ice and huge ice shelves - floating extensions of land ice jutting out from the coast.Sea-ice acts as a protective sleeve for the ice covering the land and prevents the ocean from heating up.Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey explains that the impacts of shrinking sea-ice may become evident as the season transitions to summer - when there's potential for an unstoppable feedback loop of ice melting.As more sea-ice disappears, it exposes dark areas of ocean, which absorb sunlight instead of reflecting it, meaning that the heat energy is added into the water, which in turn melts more ice. Scientists call this the ice-albedo effect.That could add a lot more heat to the planet, disrupting Antarctica's usual role as a regulator of global temperatures."Are we awakening this giant of Antarctica?" asks Prof Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at the University of Exeter. It would be "an absolute disaster for the world," he says.There are signs that what is already happening to Antarctica's ice sheets is in the worst-case scenario range of what was predicted, says Prof Anna Hogg, an Earth scientist at the University of Leeds.Since the 1990s, the loss of land ice from Antarctica has contributed 7.2mm to sea-level rise.Even modest increases in sea levels can result in dangerously high storm surges that could wipe out coastal communities. If significant amounts of land ice were to start melting, the impacts would be catastrophic for millions of people around the world.As a self-contained continent surrounded by water, Antarctica has its own weather and climate system. Until 2016 Antarctica's winter sea-ice had actually been growing in size.But in March 2022 an extreme heatwave hit East Antarctica, pushing temperatures to -10C when they should have been closer to -50C."When I started studying the Antarctic 30 years ago, we never thought extreme weather events could happen there," says Prof Siegert.Sea-ice has broken record minimums in summer for three of the past seven years, including February 2023.Some scientists even believe these low ice records may indicate a fundamental change is happening to the continent - a shift in the conditions which have kept the region insulated.Antarctica's remoteness and shortage of historical information means a lot is still unknown.The region is still the "Wild West" in scientific terms, according to Dr Robbie Mallett.Scientists know how far the sea-ice spreads, but not, for instance, how thick it is. Unlocking that puzzle could radically change climate models for the region.At the scientific base Rothera, Dr Mallett is using radar instruments to study sea-ice thickness for an international research project called Defiant.He and other scientists are still trying to disentangle the causes of the vanishing winter ice."There is a chance that it's a really freak expression of natural variability," he says, meaning that lots of natural factors could have built up and are affecting the region simultaneously.This year's record-warm oceans are likely a contributing factor, scientists suggest - warm water will not freeze.And there may have also been changes in ocean currents and the winds that drive temperatures in the Antarctic.The El Niño weather phenomenon, currently developing in the Pacific, could also be subtly contributing to shrinking sea-ice, although it is still weak.Dr Mallett says there are "very, very good reasons to be worried"."It's potentially a really alarming sign of Antarctic climate change that hasn't been there for the last 40 years. And it's only just emerging now."© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

Headline: Britain's impossible dilemma over China's electric cars
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66820791
Content:
The UK is facing a dilemma: should it fight the rising imports of Chinese electric cars with big new tariffs, in the same way the EU has threatened to do this week? Or should it allow them to continue? Keeping open to the imports in would make it easier for the UK to hit its goal of no new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and it would make electric cars cheaper. But the UK car industry could be damaged.The British car industry is showing off its green electric future at a Bedfordshire racetrack, and behind the marques, some familiar, some less so, there is a new force.China is cornering the market in electric vehicles.A friendly man from Chinese firm BYD shows me the Atto."We're really proud of this car," says Mark Blundell. "It's new to the market, and packed full of technology. In simple terms we can pack 50% more battery into less space."The car's interior is inspired by a gym. It has a heat pump as standard, vegan leather, and strings on the door map-pocket tight enough to "get a tune out of". The display screen on the dashboard rotates at the press of a button.For now, hands should still be on the steering wheel, though China expects to be ahead of the game on autonomous driving too.And the all important battery life and range? Impressive.China has cornered the market in electric vehicle batteries. Indeed, many of the new car companies, including Byd, started off as battery manufacturers.BYD stands for "Build Your Dreams", and they are on course to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles this year. If hybrids are included, they are already number one.BYD, long-backed by legendary US investor Warren Buffett, has just started selling in the UK, and recently wooed the Munich motor show with six models heading for Europe.Other Chinese brands, such as FunkyCat and Nio, are not yet as well known in Europe.There are also more-established brands, such as the Volvo-linked Polestar, and the formerly Oxford-based MG cars, which are being shipped from China.Moreover, most Teslas in the UK in recent years have been shipped from China, made in the Shanghai Gigafactory that was built in six months in 2019.In total, China has already overtaken Germany for overall global car exports, and will overtake Japan this year, becoming the world's top exporter, according to figures from Moody's Analytics.This is no accident according to Andy Palmer, the former Aston Martin and Nissan boss."Twenty years ago, I was sitting on the board of [Chinese carmaker] Dongfeng. It was the decree of the Chinese government that Chinese car companies needed to leapfrog over western companies and the best way of doing that was to adopt new energy vehicles, as they called them at the time. That ultimately, of course, meant battery-electric vehicles," he says.That strategic planning for dominance in this sector meant China carved up capability on batteries, motors and the raw materials supply chains stretching across the world.Now the scale they have, combined with subsidies, mean Chinese manufacturers are able to undercut other global players, Mr Palmer says.It is also important to note that there are fundamental differences between the production of an electric vehicle and a conventional combustion engine car.Much more of the car's value is in the battery, compared to the value of the engine in relation to the rest of the car.The technology and transmission is more straightforward too. If you have the batteries, it is far easier to add wheels and the technology around it.Companies like BYD are ahead of the game when it comes to innovative battery technology, and are achieving ranges of as much as 400 miles without the use of cobalt and nickel. Both rare metals pose acute supply and environmental challenges, cobalt thanks to its connection with conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nickel given its dependence on Russia.But the bottom line is that the cars perform well and look the part, being sold at competitive prices.As Jon Bentley, author of Autopia and presenter of the Gadget Show says: "[Chinese imports] could really change the European market quite considerably in a way the Japanese car industry did in the 70s and 80s."Given that it's the price that is stopping many of us adopting electric cars, they are potentially a huge market force that we're about to discover being unleashed upon us".Eliminating new combustion engine vehicles over the next decade is the single biggest contributor to the government's path to net zero. So cheaper Chinese models could play a big role in the same way cheaper solar panels did.On the other hand, even if tariffs are applied to Chinese imports, the European and British car industry may struggle to compete.A car industry veteran told me earlier this year that Chinese firms were "sewing up the dealerships".Chinese companies have chosen to expand their exports into Europe and the rest of the world, but not into the US.So it was striking and inevitable that the European Union announced a new probe into Chinese electric vehicles this week.The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they had not forgotten how the solar industry was affected by China's "unfair trade practices"."Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily-subsidised Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market," she said.In the industry, this is seen as a mainly French push, with the Germans a little more sceptical.German industry is more invested in tie-ups with Chinese industry and its premium brands stand to suffer the most if what began this week escalates into a trade war.The Chinese government hit back, calling the investigation "a naked protectionist act".The process takes just over a year, and could lead to extra, even punitive tariffs, levied on car imports into Europe.It raises the question of what might happen here in the UK.The independent Trade Remedies Authority, the post-Brexit organisation responsible for assessing unfair trade, said it has "invited" carmakers to make a complaint and supply data showing harm done by subsidised Chinese electric vehicles.Neither the industry body, nor individual carmakers have done so, so far.But some in the industry say that if the EU were to apply punitive tariffs, then China's export drive could be refocused on the UK.The government does reserve some powers to act on trade defence issues.It is intriguing that the Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch did this week cite competition from China in her push to get the EU to delay the Brexit trade deal restrictions on the electric vehicle trade.But there is an extra twist on this issue for carmakers in Britain, which some privately describe as "farcical".In a few weeks' time the government will introduce its Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, designed to force carmakers down the path towards hitting targets to eliminate the sale of the combustion engine.If a car company misses its target that 22% of its sales are electric, starting in January, it will either face fines of £15,000 per vehicle, or have to buy a surplus credit from a company that has sold lots of electric vehicles.It happens to be the case that the Chinese-made import brands are mainly all electric.The net result of all this, fear some in the car industry, is a system where existing UK manufacturers, including of hybrid cars, will pay thousands of pounds to subsidise electric imports.Essentially, UK factories, which face competition from Chinese electric imports, could have to subsidise them.While this is not the intention of the policy it could be the inadvertent effect.The government has not yet published its response to a consultation on this that closed four months ago.The expectation in the industry is that sufficient flexibilities will be introduced to prevent this issue.But the system is just weeks away from being introduced. And it is clear that the general architecture of the ZEV mandate is designed to provide a carrot for electric importers, including from China, and a stick for actual producers of existing cars in the UK.Right now, the EU is looking at restricting Chinese electric vehicle sales, whereas the UK could inadvertently be subsidising them.Is this part of a conscious post-Brexit strategy to help the British consumer, with an anti-protectionist free trade approach? Does the route to mass adoption of zero carbon technologies go through Shanghai?None of this is happening in a vacuum. Apart from the commercial challenge, many in Parliament are distinctly uneasy about aiding Chinese dominance in a sector as totemic and strategic as the automotive industry.Are cars different from TVs and Iphones, or more like semi-conductors, 5G infrastructure and energy?The strategic question is how China cleaned up with two decades of long-term planning on electric cars and their batteries, on a clear and predictable consequence of a net zero agenda pushed by the G7 western nations.The more immediate question for Britain is whether we go for cheaper Chinese imports to aid mass adoption of a key net zero technology, or prioritise domestic production.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: UN calls for radical changes to slow warming
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66753909
Content:
Tackling climate change needs a rapid transformation of the way our world works, travels, eats and uses energy, according to an important UN review.This is the first "global stocktake" to examine the efforts of countries to reduce planet-warming emissions since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.While progress has been made, efforts now need to be massively scaled up.The report calls for "radical decarbonisation" with a fast phase out of fossil fuels without carbon capture.Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide, which is the main driver of climate change. Carbon capture in industrial processes and power stations stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either reuses it or stores it underground.Renewable energy also needs significant expansion while deforestation needs to be halted and reversed by 2030.The stocktake report will be considered by political leaders and will be central to global climate talks in Dubai later this year.Over the course of the past two years, the UN has set out to review the promises made by countries who signed the Paris agreement in 2015. At the meeting eight years ago, countries agreed to keep the amount of warming since the industrial revolution well below 2C and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C.The report examines their efforts to cut carbon, to adapt to climate change and how they have mobilised finance and technology to help poorer nations deal with the problem.No country is named and shamed in this report, which considers the collective approach to tackling the problem.Much progress has been made, the document acknowledges, but the global rise in temperatures predicted for this century is still well above what was promised in Paris.Keeping to those goals will now require a significant uptick in ambition according to the stocktake, which calls for widespread "system transformation".This means that every aspect of our societies needs to change to rein in rising temperatures.This includes the way we make energy, the way we travel, work and produce food.  Experts say this type of change needs governments to take the initiative and make sure that their climate actions aren't immediately nullified by other policies and investments."One could also see the call for system transformations as a recognition that, while we still can, we should take our destiny in our own hands," said Dr Richard Klein from the Stockholm Environment Institute, who was involved in the initial stages of the stocktake."Either we transform society in a way that avoids the worst of climate change, or climate change will transform society for us, in ways that are difficult to foresee but likely not to be very pleasant."The report makes a clear call for the rapid scaling up of renewable energy sources including wind and solar but also says that fossil fuels that don't capture the carbon they produce have no future.  The stocktake says that these are "indispensable elements" of a just transition to net zero by the middle of this century.Electric vehicles "offer the greatest mitigation potential" in the transport sector, according to the report which also underlines the fact that shifting to climate friendly, healthy diets, reducing food waste and fostering sustainable agriculture can make a significant difference to limiting emissions.The stocktake also examines efforts on climate adaptation and finance, something that has been a constant source of anger for developing countries. It calls for a rapid scaling up of finance from an expanded range of sources.The idea of a stocktake is to ensure that the next set of plans to cut carbon that governments register with the UN in 2025 will be more ambitious than the current ones.However the report will also form the basis of discussions at the COP28 global climate talks to be held in Dubai later this year.Efforts at COP27 to agree a phase out of all unabated fossil fuels failed due to resistance from several major oil producing nations.UN officials believe the stocktake report will increase the pressure for a major statement at COP28."I urge governments to carefully study the findings of the report and ultimately understand what it means for them and the ambitious action they must take next," said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change.Observers agree that the document is a wake-up call."We already know the world is failing to meet its climate goals, but leaders now have a concrete blueprint underpinned by a mountain of evidence for how to get the job done,"  said Ani Dasgupta from the World Resources Institute.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: No bids for offshore wind in government auction
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66749344
Content:
No new offshore wind project contracts have been bought by developers at a key government auction, dealing a blow to the UK's renewable power strategy.Results showed no bids for new offshore wind farms, but there were deals for solar, tidal and onshore wind projects.Firms have argued the price set for electricity generated was too low to make offshore wind projects viable.The government said a "global rise" in inflation impacting supply chains had "presented challenges for projects".It said while offshore and floating offshore wind projects did not feature on the agreed deals list, the outcome was "in line with similar results in countries including Germany and Spain".The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said "significant numbers" of solar power, onshore wind, tidal energy schemes, and for the first time, geothermal projects, which use heat from the ground to generate power, had been awarded funding.But the lack of offshore wind will be a blow to the pledge to deliver 50 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 compared with 14GW today.Renewable energy groups have said that alternative renewable projects, such as solar, cannot do the heavy lifting in generating the power that offshore wind does.The technology has been described as the "jewel in the UK's renewable energy crown", but firms have been hit by higher costs for building offshore farms, with materials such as steel and labour being more expensive.The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and is home to the world's four largest farms, supporting tens of thousands of jobs, which provided 13.8% of the UK's electricity generation last year, according to government statistics.The government's annual auction invites companies to bid to develop renewable energy projects and contracts to supply the UK grid with electricity. The scheme ensures projects receive a guaranteed price from the government for the electricity they will generate, which it is hoped will enable companies to have the confidence to invest.The deal, called a Contract for Difference (CFD), means if electricity prices are above the price set, the companies pay the excess back to energy suppliers, which should help to cut bills. If prices fall below the guaranteed price the energy suppliers - and customers - pay the company the difference.It was hoped offshore wind in the latest round could have helped generate five gigawatts of power, enough to run five million homes, but wind farm builders had warned for months that the government was not taking into account how much the costs of developing them had soared.Industry insiders told the BBC that the £44 per megawatt hour price floor set for the latest auction failed to take account of higher costs.Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the outcome of the auction was a "multi-billion pound lost opportunity to deliver low-cost energy for consumers and a wake-up call for government".He said the contracts had been "recognised globally as a lynchpin of the UK's offshore success", but said "the economics simply did not stand up this time around"."We need to get back on track and consider how we unlock the billions of investment in what is still one of the cheapest ways to generate power and meet the UK's long-term offshore wind ambitions for the future," he added.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, which is currently building the world's largest offshore wind farm, said offshore wind power was a much cheaper energy source and about half the price compared with other sources including fossil fuels.But he told the BBC's Today programme that while the UK needed to build more wind farms, "for this particular auction unfortunately the prices were just set too low" for electricity generated to make  investment viable.On Friday, wholesale gas prices in the UK rose by about 10% after strike action kicked off at two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Australia.Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow energy security and net zero secretary, said the result of the auction was an "absolute disaster for Britain", but should have been avoidable. He argued the government had been warned by the industry that "unless they adjusted the auction price this would happen"."They [the government] should be hanging their heads in shame," he told the BBC's Today programme.While there were no bids for offshore contracts, the government said a total of 95 clean energy projects had secured funding of £227m, up from 93 in the previous auction, securing "enough to power the equivalent of two million homes".Energy and Climate Change Minister Graham Stuart said the government was "delighted" that the auction had "seen a record number of successful projects across solar, onshore wind, tidal power and, for the first time, geo-thermal".He added that offshore wind was "central to our ambitions to decarbonise our electricity supply", and said the government would  "work with industry to make sure we retain our global leadership in this vital technology".© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Has Australia cleaned up its act on climate?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-65606208
Content:
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came to power last year promising the country would leave the climate "naughty corner".Long considered a laggard, Australia would now cut emissions, become a renewable energy powerhouse and force the biggest polluters to clean up their act, the new leader declared."I want to join the global effort," Mr Albanese told the BBC, minutes after his victory speech.It is now a year since he legislated Australia's first ever emissions reduction target - so, has he delivered?Until recently, acknowledging and tackling climate change proved a hugely contentious issue in Australia - famously playing a role in toppling three prime ministers in a decade.The country is one of the world's biggest polluters per head of population, and it has failed to make any significant cuts to its core emissions despite signing up to global pledges.But Australia is also a nation where the effects of climate change have become devastatingly obvious.In 2022 - the so-called "climate election" - there was a historic surge in support for candidates pledging urgent action, and the issue was a major factor in the demise of yet another prime minister, Scott Morrison, whose conservative government had been in power for nine years."Together we can end the climate wars," Mr Albanese said at the time.The election of his government made a huge, overnight difference to Australia's international standing, experts say.Many world leaders expressed relief at - or alluded to - the fact Australia had a new leader who appeared serious on climate change.Fiji's then PM Frank Bainimarama, whose country is among the most at risk from rising seas, welcomed Australia's plan to "put the climate first", while the UK's Boris Johnson said he looked forward with working with Mr Albanese on making the world a "better" and "greener" place.Professor Mark Howden - a vice chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - noted a change in attitude among the science and business communities too."I used to get accosted by people at conferences… people were sort of critiquing Australia's position and wondering why we weren't doing more," he tells the BBC."These days, they're very welcoming."Mr Albanese's government has enshrined into law an emissions cut target of 43% by 2030, up from 26-28%. That difference is equivalent to eliminating emissions from Australia's entire transport or agriculture sectors.It has also negotiated the introduction of a key plank of its plan to achieve that goal - a "safeguard mechanism" that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters."[That] was really the first new piece of legislation aimed to actually driving down emissions in Australia for more than a decade," Climate Council researcher Simon Bradshaw tells the BBC."We've got ourselves back in the game."The government is also looking to incentivise emissions cuts on a consumer level, through things like an electric vehicle policy that is still to be detailed.Public concern over the government's actions on climate change has fallen - 31% of Australians believe they are doing too little, down from 44% the year before, when the Morrison government was in power.But there's still "an appropriate level of cynicism" towards Australia and its climate efforts, experts say.Its new 2030 target is not enough to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by 1.1C but experts say they're optimistic that dramatic and rapid changes can still save the planet.However Australia's target is also weaker than many of its international peers, such as the US or UK."We're not laggards anymore, but neither are we leaders," Prof Howden says.Critics are chiefly concerned that the government has refused to outlaw new coal, oil and gas projects.New projects will not just be a hurdle for domestic emissions targets. It is the global implication that is most grim - Australia is one of the world's biggest fossil fuel exporters.The IPCC says new fossil fuel projects are not compatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement, and in fact, existing infrastructure must be urgently phased out.But the Australian government has already greenlit three new coal mine projects - including one just last week.That Australia persists with new fossil fuel projects despite declaring a new era on climate is "extremely reckless" and "no doubt confusing" to others across the globe, Dr Bradshaw says."There are questions being asked by our international peers, as they should be," he says."The science here is unequivocal… it compels us to leave our fossil fuels in the ground. Every new project that is developed and every tonne of carbon we burn is pushing us closer to catastrophe."Experts say there is still plenty more the government could - and must - do to drive its emissions down.At the top of those calls is a comprehensive price on greenhouse gas emissions, like those in place in the UK, Canada and Scandinavia."Almost every economist across the globe would say [that] is the best and most efficient way of reducing emissions," says Prof Howden."In an ideal world, that would be what we do next [but] we're living in a world where politics has made that a toxic ground to occupy," he says, referring to a carbon tax furore that played a big role in the downfall of former Australian leader Julia Gillard in 2013.A carbon price isn't part of the government's official climate policy, and Mr Albanese has previously suggested such a measure wouldn't be necessary anymore thanks to cheaper renewable energy.But there's room for improvement there too, experts say.Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, and is surrounded by seas which could be used for hydro-electric power. But currently only about 30% of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources - significantly below than the UK, for example, which is far less blessed with natural resources.Australia's government has a lofty goal of making that 82% by the end of the decade. It envisages this will both drive down emissions and enable Australia to replace fossil fuel exports.Others like Dr Bradshaw and the Greens party say reform to Australia's environment laws so that they factor in the climate impacts of developments is desperately needed, pointing to recent mine approvals.So while there is renewed optimism overall, so far there's little actual progress in emissions cuts themselves.With 2030 now only seven years away, the country's emissions have dropped by about 21% against the 2005 benchmark it set, according to government figures.But that is mainly because it is cutting down fewer trees - which capture and store carbon. That's something expert say often hides true emission trends.In reality, the country's gross emissions have barely budged - dropping by just 1.5%."Having lost many years, we're really just at the start of this journey… it does take time to turn the ship around. We can meet those targets… but it does mean accomplishing a lot early on in this decade," Dr Bradshaw says.This video can not be playedWATCH: New Australian PM says climate action "shouldn't be controversial"© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Could Sunak's green review threaten UK net zero?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66867679
Content:
The prime minister has said he wants to be honest about the "costs and trade-offs" of tackling climate change.In a statement on Tuesday, Rishi Sunak said he was proud that "Britain is leading the world on climate change", and will stick by the agreements the UK has made internationally.But he then overhauled measures designed to meet these targets.So, is the UK really a world leader on emissions cuts, and how will the changes the PM announced  affect its efforts?Mr Sunak said the government was still "completely committed" to the 2050 net zero target which his predecessor, Theresa May, made law back in 2019.Net zero means a country does not add any additional greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."This country is proud to be a world leader in reaching net zero by 2050. But we simply won't achieve it unless we change. We'll now have a more pragmatic, proportionate, and realistic approach that eases the burdens on families," he said.It is true the UK has been successful in cutting emissions compared to other countries.Since 1990, emissions within the UK have fallen by 48.7% up to the end of 2022 - excluding international aviation and shipping - according to government data.These cuts are greater than other countries in the G7 (Group of Seven), an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called "advanced" economies - although Germany has reduced its emissions at a faster rate compared with the UK since 2015.But the cuts the UK has made so far are - arguably - the easiest ones.One of the main ways they have been achieved is by switching away from fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to generate electricity.Emissions from electricity generation have fallen by around three-quarters since 1990, while the proportion of electricity generated by renewables - like wind and solar - has soared.The government has bold plans to continue this "decarbonisation" process.But achieving net zero means cutting emissions across all sectors of the economy.That is why there are targets for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles and switching from gas boilers to heat pumps or other low-carbon alternatives to heat our homes.And, despite the UK's achievements on climate so far, there have been a number of warnings that progress is beginning to falter. These came even before today's announcement.Earlier this year, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) - the government's independent advisers on cutting carbon emissions - warned that the UK's efforts to meet its net zero commitments were already "worryingly slow".It also said it was "markedly less confident" than a year earlier that it would meet its 2030 and 2035 emissions reduction targets.Similar warnings on electricity have come from the National Audit Office and a cross-party group of MPs.But contrary to these findings, Mr Sunak claimed in his announcement that the UK was "on track" to meet its commitments.He also announced a substantial increase in the subsidies available to people who want to install heat pumps to heat their home, with the grant increased by 50% to £7,500.The CCC says it was not consulted ahead of the announcement, and needed to do the full calculations before determining the carbon cost.But the changes certainly seem to make the current targets much harder to achieve - as any extra carbon costs would have to be balanced by extra savings in other areas. And how much carbon the UK can use in coming years has already been set down in carbon budgets."Today's announcement is likely to take the UK further away from being able to meet its legal commitments," said Piers Forster, the CCC's chair."This, coupled with the recent unsuccessful offshore wind auction, gives us concern," and "more action is needed," he added."What's depressing about all the changes [the PM] has told us about is they all go in the same direction," Prof Miles Allen of the University of Oxford told the BBC."If we do everything slower, we're just going to make it more difficult to reach that target," he said.One of the most eye-catching changes is delaying the 2030 ban on sales of new, fully petrol and diesel cars, announced by Mr Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson.Despite what's often assumed, electric car sales are actually surging. In 2022, nearly 17% of new car sales were battery electric - ahead of the CCC's schedule and up from less than 2% in 2019.Some in the car industry have warned that delaying the ban on new petrol and diesel cars could hit investment and therefore electric vehicle sales.Achieving the 2030 phase-out of new fully petrol and diesel car and van sales is "vital to meeting the UK's decarbonisation pathway", the CCC warned in June.But Mr Sunak says it should be the consumer who decides whether or not to buy an electric car and not "government forcing you to do it". He also says the new plan is in line with countries including Germany, France, Spain and Canada.Mr Sunak says his review of the government's green pledges is all about putting the "long-term interests of our country before the short-term political needs of the moment."He said "some of the things that were being proposed would have cost typical families upwards of five, ten, fifteen thousand pounds".But the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) - an independent climate change think tank - points out that nobody is being forced to take up these measures right now.For example, the planned ban on the sale of new gas boilers was due to start in 2035 for all households. It is only relevant when your boiler breaks or you choose to switch.It is a similar story with cars.  Four out of five of us buy second-hand cars - for which there is no phase-out date - and older cars can continue to be driven after 2030.The 20% of people who can afford to buy a new car already had six years until they would have had to choose between fully electric vehicles and hybrids - which can be filled up with petrol. Now they have 11 years.The changes to net zero policy "will add to the cost of living for those struggling, not make things easier", argues Peter Chalkley, a director of the ECIU.And an analysis by the ECIU suggests the PM's announcements could cost British households almost £8bn in higher bills over the next decade - and more if gas prices spike again - due to cancelling new energy efficiency regulations for the private rental sector.The CCC has estimated that meeting the legally binding 2050 goal will require an extra £50bn of investment every year by 2030.It said that once the savings from reduced use of fossil fuels are factored in, the overall resource cost of the transition to net zero is less than 1% of GDP over the next 30 years. By 2044 it should become cost-saving, the CCC said, as newer cleaner technologies are more efficient than those they are replacing.Many scientists have pointed out to the BBC that delaying investment simply increases the ultimate cost.And of course, the global costs of climate inaction would be much higher, as the world would be hit by increasingly damaging climate impacts.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Climate change played major role in Libya floods
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66854670
Content:
Climate change made the storm that devastated the Libyan city of Derna, killing thousands of people, up to 50 times more likely, experts say.Up to 50% more rain had fallen as a result of human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, climate scientists at the World Weather Attribution group found.Years of conflict in the region compounded the vulnerability of people to flooding, the WWA report says.And it turned the extreme weather into a full-scale humanitarian disaster.The scientists used computer simulations to assess how much more likely such a storm was now compared with before the 1.1C of warming climate change has already brought.But they cautioned a lack of data, particularly in Libya, meant considerable uncertainties in their findings.Storm Daniel, which brought the deadly rains, had already dumped 910mm (35in) of rain on parts of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, killing 28 people.And the study found climate change had made this up to 10 times more likely, bringing up to 40% more rain.Storms of this intensity are now reasonably common for this region and can be expected once every 10 years, it warns.But the weather event in northern Libya was much more exceptional, bringing a storm of an intensity such as would be expected to hit northern Libya once every 300-600 years.As Storm Daniel travelled slowly over the Mediterranean, it drew additional energy from sea temperatures two to three degrees above the September average."Storm Daniel was [a] low pressure [weather system], as we usually have in the Mediterranean," Kostas Lagouvardos, from the National Observatory of Athens, says. "It was not very deep - but it was very early in the season and it was stagnant and stayed over the south Ionian Sea for four, five days."That extra warmth fuelled stronger winds and meant the air could hold more moisture.And when it hit the northern coast of Libya, it dumped an estimated 400mm of rain on Derna in just 24 hours.The average for September in the city is just 1.5mm, according to Nasa's Earth Observatory.The huge impact shows how intense weather can combine with a vulnerable population with disastrous consequences, the scientists say.In Libya, the ousting of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011, was followed by political instability and civil war.Two dams in the river above Derna were old and poorly maintained. Many houses had been built on the flood-plain. And when they burst, tens of millions of cubic metres of water poured into the city, sweeping away entire neighbourhoods.The scientists warned their findings had large mathematical uncertainties, as:"After a summer of devastating heatwaves and wildfires with a very clear climate-change fingerprint, quantifying the contribution of global warming to these floods proved more challenging," one of the study's authors, Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, said."While we have some weather station data over Greece, we don't have any weather station data over Libya."Instead, the scientists had to rely on data based on satellite readings.But they are confident climate change played a significant role, because there is very strong evidence higher temperatures lead to heavier rainfall and other studies have shown climate change increases the intensity of weather systems such as Storm Daniel.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Antarctic ice at 'mind-blowing' low alarms experts
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66724246
Content:
The sea-ice surrounding Antarctica is well below any previous recorded winter level, satellite data shows, a worrying new benchmark for a region that once seemed resistant to global warming."It's so far outside anything we've seen, it's almost mind-blowing," says Walter Meier, who monitors sea-ice with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.An unstable Antarctica could have far-reaching consequences, polar experts warn.Antarctica's huge ice expanse regulates the planet's temperature, as the white surface reflects the Sun's energy back into the atmosphere and also cools the water beneath and near it.Without its ice cooling the planet, Antarctica could transform from Earth's refrigerator to a radiator, experts say.The ice that floats on the Antarctic Ocean's surface now measures less than 17 million sq km - that is 1.5 million sq km of sea-ice less than the September average, and well below previous winter record lows.That's an area of missing ice about five times the size of the British Isles.Dr Meier is not optimistic that the sea-ice will recover to a significant degree.Scientists are still trying to identify all the factors that led to this year's low sea-ice - but studying trends in Antarctica has historically been challenging.In a year when several global heat and ocean temperature records have broken, some scientists insist the low sea-ice is the measure to pay attention to."We can see how much more vulnerable it is," says Dr Robbie Mallett, of the University of Manitoba, who is based on the Antarctic peninsula.Already braving isolation, extreme cold and powerful winds, this year's thin sea-ice has made his team's work even more difficult. "There is a risk that it breaks off and drifts out to sea with us on it," Dr Mallett says.Sea-ice forms in the continent's winter (March to October) before largely melting in summer, and is part of an interconnected system that also consists of icebergs, land ice and huge ice shelves - floating extensions of land ice jutting out from the coast.Sea-ice acts as a protective sleeve for the ice covering the land and prevents the ocean from heating up.Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey explains that the impacts of shrinking sea-ice may become evident as the season transitions to summer - when there's potential for an unstoppable feedback loop of ice melting.As more sea-ice disappears, it exposes dark areas of ocean, which absorb sunlight instead of reflecting it, meaning that the heat energy is added into the water, which in turn melts more ice. Scientists call this the ice-albedo effect.That could add a lot more heat to the planet, disrupting Antarctica's usual role as a regulator of global temperatures."Are we awakening this giant of Antarctica?" asks Prof Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at the University of Exeter. It would be "an absolute disaster for the world," he says.There are signs that what is already happening to Antarctica's ice sheets is in the worst-case scenario range of what was predicted, says Prof Anna Hogg, an Earth scientist at the University of Leeds.Since the 1990s, the loss of land ice from Antarctica has contributed 7.2mm to sea-level rise.Even modest increases in sea levels can result in dangerously high storm surges that could wipe out coastal communities. If significant amounts of land ice were to start melting, the impacts would be catastrophic for millions of people around the world.As a self-contained continent surrounded by water, Antarctica has its own weather and climate system. Until 2016 Antarctica's winter sea-ice had actually been growing in size.But in March 2022 an extreme heatwave hit East Antarctica, pushing temperatures to -10C when they should have been closer to -50C."When I started studying the Antarctic 30 years ago, we never thought extreme weather events could happen there," says Prof Siegert.Sea-ice has broken record minimums in summer for three of the past seven years, including February 2023.Some scientists even believe these low ice records may indicate a fundamental change is happening to the continent - a shift in the conditions which have kept the region insulated.Antarctica's remoteness and shortage of historical information means a lot is still unknown.The region is still the "Wild West" in scientific terms, according to Dr Robbie Mallett.Scientists know how far the sea-ice spreads, but not, for instance, how thick it is. Unlocking that puzzle could radically change climate models for the region.At the scientific base Rothera, Dr Mallett is using radar instruments to study sea-ice thickness for an international research project called Defiant.He and other scientists are still trying to disentangle the causes of the vanishing winter ice."There is a chance that it's a really freak expression of natural variability," he says, meaning that lots of natural factors could have built up and are affecting the region simultaneously.This year's record-warm oceans are likely a contributing factor, scientists suggest - warm water will not freeze.And there may have also been changes in ocean currents and the winds that drive temperatures in the Antarctic.The El Niño weather phenomenon, currently developing in the Pacific, could also be subtly contributing to shrinking sea-ice, although it is still weak.Dr Mallett says there are "very, very good reasons to be worried"."It's potentially a really alarming sign of Antarctic climate change that hasn't been there for the last 40 years. And it's only just emerging now."© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

Headline: Britain's impossible dilemma over China's electric cars
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66820791
Content:
The UK is facing a dilemma: should it fight the rising imports of Chinese electric cars with big new tariffs, in the same way the EU has threatened to do this week? Or should it allow them to continue? Keeping open to the imports in would make it easier for the UK to hit its goal of no new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and it would make electric cars cheaper. But the UK car industry could be damaged.The British car industry is showing off its green electric future at a Bedfordshire racetrack, and behind the marques, some familiar, some less so, there is a new force.China is cornering the market in electric vehicles.A friendly man from Chinese firm BYD shows me the Atto."We're really proud of this car," says Mark Blundell. "It's new to the market, and packed full of technology. In simple terms we can pack 50% more battery into less space."The car's interior is inspired by a gym. It has a heat pump as standard, vegan leather, and strings on the door map-pocket tight enough to "get a tune out of". The display screen on the dashboard rotates at the press of a button.For now, hands should still be on the steering wheel, though China expects to be ahead of the game on autonomous driving too.And the all important battery life and range? Impressive.China has cornered the market in electric vehicle batteries. Indeed, many of the new car companies, including Byd, started off as battery manufacturers.BYD stands for "Build Your Dreams", and they are on course to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles this year. If hybrids are included, they are already number one.BYD, long-backed by legendary US investor Warren Buffett, has just started selling in the UK, and recently wooed the Munich motor show with six models heading for Europe.Other Chinese brands, such as FunkyCat and Nio, are not yet as well known in Europe.There are also more-established brands, such as the Volvo-linked Polestar, and the formerly Oxford-based MG cars, which are being shipped from China.Moreover, most Teslas in the UK in recent years have been shipped from China, made in the Shanghai Gigafactory that was built in six months in 2019.In total, China has already overtaken Germany for overall global car exports, and will overtake Japan this year, becoming the world's top exporter, according to figures from Moody's Analytics.This is no accident according to Andy Palmer, the former Aston Martin and Nissan boss."Twenty years ago, I was sitting on the board of [Chinese carmaker] Dongfeng. It was the decree of the Chinese government that Chinese car companies needed to leapfrog over western companies and the best way of doing that was to adopt new energy vehicles, as they called them at the time. That ultimately, of course, meant battery-electric vehicles," he says.That strategic planning for dominance in this sector meant China carved up capability on batteries, motors and the raw materials supply chains stretching across the world.Now the scale they have, combined with subsidies, mean Chinese manufacturers are able to undercut other global players, Mr Palmer says.It is also important to note that there are fundamental differences between the production of an electric vehicle and a conventional combustion engine car.Much more of the car's value is in the battery, compared to the value of the engine in relation to the rest of the car.The technology and transmission is more straightforward too. If you have the batteries, it is far easier to add wheels and the technology around it.Companies like BYD are ahead of the game when it comes to innovative battery technology, and are achieving ranges of as much as 400 miles without the use of cobalt and nickel. Both rare metals pose acute supply and environmental challenges, cobalt thanks to its connection with conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nickel given its dependence on Russia.But the bottom line is that the cars perform well and look the part, being sold at competitive prices.As Jon Bentley, author of Autopia and presenter of the Gadget Show says: "[Chinese imports] could really change the European market quite considerably in a way the Japanese car industry did in the 70s and 80s."Given that it's the price that is stopping many of us adopting electric cars, they are potentially a huge market force that we're about to discover being unleashed upon us".Eliminating new combustion engine vehicles over the next decade is the single biggest contributor to the government's path to net zero. So cheaper Chinese models could play a big role in the same way cheaper solar panels did.On the other hand, even if tariffs are applied to Chinese imports, the European and British car industry may struggle to compete.A car industry veteran told me earlier this year that Chinese firms were "sewing up the dealerships".Chinese companies have chosen to expand their exports into Europe and the rest of the world, but not into the US.So it was striking and inevitable that the European Union announced a new probe into Chinese electric vehicles this week.The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they had not forgotten how the solar industry was affected by China's "unfair trade practices"."Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily-subsidised Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market," she said.In the industry, this is seen as a mainly French push, with the Germans a little more sceptical.German industry is more invested in tie-ups with Chinese industry and its premium brands stand to suffer the most if what began this week escalates into a trade war.The Chinese government hit back, calling the investigation "a naked protectionist act".The process takes just over a year, and could lead to extra, even punitive tariffs, levied on car imports into Europe.It raises the question of what might happen here in the UK.The independent Trade Remedies Authority, the post-Brexit organisation responsible for assessing unfair trade, said it has "invited" carmakers to make a complaint and supply data showing harm done by subsidised Chinese electric vehicles.Neither the industry body, nor individual carmakers have done so, so far.But some in the industry say that if the EU were to apply punitive tariffs, then China's export drive could be refocused on the UK.The government does reserve some powers to act on trade defence issues.It is intriguing that the Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch did this week cite competition from China in her push to get the EU to delay the Brexit trade deal restrictions on the electric vehicle trade.But there is an extra twist on this issue for carmakers in Britain, which some privately describe as "farcical".In a few weeks' time the government will introduce its Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, designed to force carmakers down the path towards hitting targets to eliminate the sale of the combustion engine.If a car company misses its target that 22% of its sales are electric, starting in January, it will either face fines of £15,000 per vehicle, or have to buy a surplus credit from a company that has sold lots of electric vehicles.It happens to be the case that the Chinese-made import brands are mainly all electric.The net result of all this, fear some in the car industry, is a system where existing UK manufacturers, including of hybrid cars, will pay thousands of pounds to subsidise electric imports.Essentially, UK factories, which face competition from Chinese electric imports, could have to subsidise them.While this is not the intention of the policy it could be the inadvertent effect.The government has not yet published its response to a consultation on this that closed four months ago.The expectation in the industry is that sufficient flexibilities will be introduced to prevent this issue.But the system is just weeks away from being introduced. And it is clear that the general architecture of the ZEV mandate is designed to provide a carrot for electric importers, including from China, and a stick for actual producers of existing cars in the UK.Right now, the EU is looking at restricting Chinese electric vehicle sales, whereas the UK could inadvertently be subsidising them.Is this part of a conscious post-Brexit strategy to help the British consumer, with an anti-protectionist free trade approach? Does the route to mass adoption of zero carbon technologies go through Shanghai?None of this is happening in a vacuum. Apart from the commercial challenge, many in Parliament are distinctly uneasy about aiding Chinese dominance in a sector as totemic and strategic as the automotive industry.Are cars different from TVs and Iphones, or more like semi-conductors, 5G infrastructure and energy?The strategic question is how China cleaned up with two decades of long-term planning on electric cars and their batteries, on a clear and predictable consequence of a net zero agenda pushed by the G7 western nations.The more immediate question for Britain is whether we go for cheaper Chinese imports to aid mass adoption of a key net zero technology, or prioritise domestic production.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: UN calls for radical changes to slow warming

Content:
Tackling climate change needs a rapid transformation of the way our world works, travels, eats and uses energy, according to an important UN review.This is the first "global stocktake" to examine the efforts of countries to reduce planet-warming emissions since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.While progress has been made, efforts now need to be massively scaled up.The report calls for "radical decarbonisation" with a fast phase out of fossil fuels without carbon capture.Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide, which is the main driver of climate change. Carbon capture in industrial processes and power stations stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either reuses it or stores it underground.Renewable energy also needs significant expansion while deforestation needs to be halted and reversed by 2030.The stocktake report will be considered by political leaders and will be central to global climate talks in Dubai later this year.Over the course of the past two years, the UN has set out to review the promises made by countries who signed the Paris agreement in 2015. At the meeting eight years ago, countries agreed to keep the amount of warming since the industrial revolution well below 2C and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C.The report examines their efforts to cut carbon, to adapt to climate change and how they have mobilised finance and technology to help poorer nations deal with the problem.No country is named and shamed in this report, which considers the collective approach to tackling the problem.Much progress has been made, the document acknowledges, but the global rise in temperatures predicted for this century is still well above what was promised in Paris.Keeping to those goals will now require a significant uptick in ambition according to the stocktake, which calls for widespread "system transformation".This means that every aspect of our societies needs to change to rein in rising temperatures.This includes the way we make energy, the way we travel, work and produce food.  Experts say this type of change needs governments to take the initiative and make sure that their climate actions aren't immediately nullified by other policies and investments."One could also see the call for system transformations as a recognition that, while we still can, we should take our destiny in our own hands," said Dr Richard Klein from the Stockholm Environment Institute, who was involved in the initial stages of the stocktake."Either we transform society in a way that avoids the worst of climate change, or climate change will transform society for us, in ways that are difficult to foresee but likely not to be very pleasant."The report makes a clear call for the rapid scaling up of renewable energy sources including wind and solar but also says that fossil fuels that don't capture the carbon they produce have no future.  The stocktake says that these are "indispensable elements" of a just transition to net zero by the middle of this century.Electric vehicles "offer the greatest mitigation potential" in the transport sector, according to the report which also underlines the fact that shifting to climate friendly, healthy diets, reducing food waste and fostering sustainable agriculture can make a significant difference to limiting emissions.The stocktake also examines efforts on climate adaptation and finance, something that has been a constant source of anger for developing countries. It calls for a rapid scaling up of finance from an expanded range of sources.The idea of a stocktake is to ensure that the next set of plans to cut carbon that governments register with the UN in 2025 will be more ambitious than the current ones.However the report will also form the basis of discussions at the COP28 global climate talks to be held in Dubai later this year.Efforts at COP27 to agree a phase out of all unabated fossil fuels failed due to resistance from several major oil producing nations.UN officials believe the stocktake report will increase the pressure for a major statement at COP28."I urge governments to carefully study the findings of the report and ultimately understand what it means for them and the ambitious action they must take next," said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change.Observers agree that the document is a wake-up call."We already know the world is failing to meet its climate goals, but leaders now have a concrete blueprint underpinned by a mountain of evidence for how to get the job done,"  said Ani Dasgupta from the World Resources Institute.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: No bids for offshore wind in government auction
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66749344
Content:
No new offshore wind project contracts have been bought by developers at a key government auction, dealing a blow to the UK's renewable power strategy.Results showed no bids for new offshore wind farms, but there were deals for solar, tidal and onshore wind projects.Firms have argued the price set for electricity generated was too low to make offshore wind projects viable.The government said a "global rise" in inflation impacting supply chains had "presented challenges for projects".It said while offshore and floating offshore wind projects did not feature on the agreed deals list, the outcome was "in line with similar results in countries including Germany and Spain".The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said "significant numbers" of solar power, onshore wind, tidal energy schemes, and for the first time, geothermal projects, which use heat from the ground to generate power, had been awarded funding.But the lack of offshore wind will be a blow to the pledge to deliver 50 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 compared with 14GW today.Renewable energy groups have said that alternative renewable projects, such as solar, cannot do the heavy lifting in generating the power that offshore wind does.The technology has been described as the "jewel in the UK's renewable energy crown", but firms have been hit by higher costs for building offshore farms, with materials such as steel and labour being more expensive.The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and is home to the world's four largest farms, supporting tens of thousands of jobs, which provided 13.8% of the UK's electricity generation last year, according to government statistics.The government's annual auction invites companies to bid to develop renewable energy projects and contracts to supply the UK grid with electricity. The scheme ensures projects receive a guaranteed price from the government for the electricity they will generate, which it is hoped will enable companies to have the confidence to invest.The deal, called a Contract for Difference (CFD), means if electricity prices are above the price set, the companies pay the excess back to energy suppliers, which should help to cut bills. If prices fall below the guaranteed price the energy suppliers - and customers - pay the company the difference.It was hoped offshore wind in the latest round could have helped generate five gigawatts of power, enough to run five million homes, but wind farm builders had warned for months that the government was not taking into account how much the costs of developing them had soared.Industry insiders told the BBC that the £44 per megawatt hour price floor set for the latest auction failed to take account of higher costs.Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the outcome of the auction was a "multi-billion pound lost opportunity to deliver low-cost energy for consumers and a wake-up call for government".He said the contracts had been "recognised globally as a lynchpin of the UK's offshore success", but said "the economics simply did not stand up this time around"."We need to get back on track and consider how we unlock the billions of investment in what is still one of the cheapest ways to generate power and meet the UK's long-term offshore wind ambitions for the future," he added.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, which is currently building the world's largest offshore wind farm, said offshore wind power was a much cheaper energy source and about half the price compared with other sources including fossil fuels.But he told the BBC's Today programme that while the UK needed to build more wind farms, "for this particular auction unfortunately the prices were just set too low" for electricity generated to make  investment viable.On Friday, wholesale gas prices in the UK rose by about 10% after strike action kicked off at two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Australia.Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow energy security and net zero secretary, said the result of the auction was an "absolute disaster for Britain", but should have been avoidable. He argued the government had been warned by the industry that "unless they adjusted the auction price this would happen"."They [the government] should be hanging their heads in shame," he told the BBC's Today programme.While there were no bids for offshore contracts, the government said a total of 95 clean energy projects had secured funding of £227m, up from 93 in the previous auction, securing "enough to power the equivalent of two million homes".Energy and Climate Change Minister Graham Stuart said the government was "delighted" that the auction had "seen a record number of successful projects across solar, onshore wind, tidal power and, for the first time, geo-thermal".He added that offshore wind was "central to our ambitions to decarbonise our electricity supply", and said the government would  "work with industry to make sure we retain our global leadership in this vital technology".© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Has Australia cleaned up its act on climate?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-65606208
Content:
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came to power last year promising the country would leave the climate "naughty corner".Long considered a laggard, Australia would now cut emissions, become a renewable energy powerhouse and force the biggest polluters to clean up their act, the new leader declared."I want to join the global effort," Mr Albanese told the BBC, minutes after his victory speech.It is now a year since he legislated Australia's first ever emissions reduction target - so, has he delivered?Until recently, acknowledging and tackling climate change proved a hugely contentious issue in Australia - famously playing a role in toppling three prime ministers in a decade.The country is one of the world's biggest polluters per head of population, and it has failed to make any significant cuts to its core emissions despite signing up to global pledges.But Australia is also a nation where the effects of climate change have become devastatingly obvious.In 2022 - the so-called "climate election" - there was a historic surge in support for candidates pledging urgent action, and the issue was a major factor in the demise of yet another prime minister, Scott Morrison, whose conservative government had been in power for nine years."Together we can end the climate wars," Mr Albanese said at the time.The election of his government made a huge, overnight difference to Australia's international standing, experts say.Many world leaders expressed relief at - or alluded to - the fact Australia had a new leader who appeared serious on climate change.Fiji's then PM Frank Bainimarama, whose country is among the most at risk from rising seas, welcomed Australia's plan to "put the climate first", while the UK's Boris Johnson said he looked forward with working with Mr Albanese on making the world a "better" and "greener" place.Professor Mark Howden - a vice chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - noted a change in attitude among the science and business communities too."I used to get accosted by people at conferences… people were sort of critiquing Australia's position and wondering why we weren't doing more," he tells the BBC."These days, they're very welcoming."Mr Albanese's government has enshrined into law an emissions cut target of 43% by 2030, up from 26-28%. That difference is equivalent to eliminating emissions from Australia's entire transport or agriculture sectors.It has also negotiated the introduction of a key plank of its plan to achieve that goal - a "safeguard mechanism" that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters."[That] was really the first new piece of legislation aimed to actually driving down emissions in Australia for more than a decade," Climate Council researcher Simon Bradshaw tells the BBC."We've got ourselves back in the game."The government is also looking to incentivise emissions cuts on a consumer level, through things like an electric vehicle policy that is still to be detailed.Public concern over the government's actions on climate change has fallen - 31% of Australians believe they are doing too little, down from 44% the year before, when the Morrison government was in power.But there's still "an appropriate level of cynicism" towards Australia and its climate efforts, experts say.Its new 2030 target is not enough to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by 1.1C but experts say they're optimistic that dramatic and rapid changes can still save the planet.However Australia's target is also weaker than many of its international peers, such as the US or UK."We're not laggards anymore, but neither are we leaders," Prof Howden says.Critics are chiefly concerned that the government has refused to outlaw new coal, oil and gas projects.New projects will not just be a hurdle for domestic emissions targets. It is the global implication that is most grim - Australia is one of the world's biggest fossil fuel exporters.The IPCC says new fossil fuel projects are not compatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement, and in fact, existing infrastructure must be urgently phased out.But the Australian government has already greenlit three new coal mine projects - including one just last week.That Australia persists with new fossil fuel projects despite declaring a new era on climate is "extremely reckless" and "no doubt confusing" to others across the globe, Dr Bradshaw says."There are questions being asked by our international peers, as they should be," he says."The science here is unequivocal… it compels us to leave our fossil fuels in the ground. Every new project that is developed and every tonne of carbon we burn is pushing us closer to catastrophe."Experts say there is still plenty more the government could - and must - do to drive its emissions down.At the top of those calls is a comprehensive price on greenhouse gas emissions, like those in place in the UK, Canada and Scandinavia."Almost every economist across the globe would say [that] is the best and most efficient way of reducing emissions," says Prof Howden."In an ideal world, that would be what we do next [but] we're living in a world where politics has made that a toxic ground to occupy," he says, referring to a carbon tax furore that played a big role in the downfall of former Australian leader Julia Gillard in 2013.A carbon price isn't part of the government's official climate policy, and Mr Albanese has previously suggested such a measure wouldn't be necessary anymore thanks to cheaper renewable energy.But there's room for improvement there too, experts say.Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, and is surrounded by seas which could be used for hydro-electric power. But currently only about 30% of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources - significantly below than the UK, for example, which is far less blessed with natural resources.Australia's government has a lofty goal of making that 82% by the end of the decade. It envisages this will both drive down emissions and enable Australia to replace fossil fuel exports.Others like Dr Bradshaw and the Greens party say reform to Australia's environment laws so that they factor in the climate impacts of developments is desperately needed, pointing to recent mine approvals.So while there is renewed optimism overall, so far there's little actual progress in emissions cuts themselves.With 2030 now only seven years away, the country's emissions have dropped by about 21% against the 2005 benchmark it set, according to government figures.But that is mainly because it is cutting down fewer trees - which capture and store carbon. That's something expert say often hides true emission trends.In reality, the country's gross emissions have barely budged - dropping by just 1.5%."Having lost many years, we're really just at the start of this journey… it does take time to turn the ship around. We can meet those targets… but it does mean accomplishing a lot early on in this decade," Dr Bradshaw says.This video can not be playedWATCH: New Australian PM says climate action "shouldn't be controversial"© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Climate change played major role in Libya floods
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66854670
Content:
Climate change made the storm that devastated the Libyan city of Derna, killing thousands of people, up to 50 times more likely, experts say.Up to 50% more rain had fallen as a result of human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, climate scientists at the World Weather Attribution group found.Years of conflict in the region compounded the vulnerability of people to flooding, the WWA report says.And it turned the extreme weather into a full-scale humanitarian disaster.The scientists used computer simulations to assess how much more likely such a storm was now compared with before the 1.1C of warming climate change has already brought.But they cautioned a lack of data, particularly in Libya, meant considerable uncertainties in their findings.Storm Daniel, which brought the deadly rains, had already dumped 910mm (35in) of rain on parts of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, killing 28 people.And the study found climate change had made this up to 10 times more likely, bringing up to 40% more rain.Storms of this intensity are now reasonably common for this region and can be expected once every 10 years, it warns.But the weather event in northern Libya was much more exceptional, bringing a storm of an intensity such as would be expected to hit northern Libya once every 300-600 years.As Storm Daniel travelled slowly over the Mediterranean, it drew additional energy from sea temperatures two to three degrees above the September average."Storm Daniel was [a] low pressure [weather system], as we usually have in the Mediterranean," Kostas Lagouvardos, from the National Observatory of Athens, says. "It was not very deep - but it was very early in the season and it was stagnant and stayed over the south Ionian Sea for four, five days."That extra warmth fuelled stronger winds and meant the air could hold more moisture.And when it hit the northern coast of Libya, it dumped an estimated 400mm of rain on Derna in just 24 hours.The average for September in the city is just 1.5mm, according to Nasa's Earth Observatory.The huge impact shows how intense weather can combine with a vulnerable population with disastrous consequences, the scientists say.In Libya, the ousting of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011, was followed by political instability and civil war.Two dams in the river above Derna were old and poorly maintained. Many houses had been built on the flood-plain. And when they burst, tens of millions of cubic metres of water poured into the city, sweeping away entire neighbourhoods.The scientists warned their findings had large mathematical uncertainties, as:"After a summer of devastating heatwaves and wildfires with a very clear climate-change fingerprint, quantifying the contribution of global warming to these floods proved more challenging," one of the study's authors, Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, said."While we have some weather station data over Greece, we don't have any weather station data over Libya."Instead, the scientists had to rely on data based on satellite readings.But they are confident climate change played a significant role, because there is very strong evidence higher temperatures lead to heavier rainfall and other studies have shown climate change increases the intensity of weather systems such as Storm Daniel.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Antarctic ice at 'mind-blowing' low alarms experts
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66724246
Content:
The sea-ice surrounding Antarctica is well below any previous recorded winter level, satellite data shows, a worrying new benchmark for a region that once seemed resistant to global warming."It's so far outside anything we've seen, it's almost mind-blowing," says Walter Meier, who monitors sea-ice with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.An unstable Antarctica could have far-reaching consequences, polar experts warn.Antarctica's huge ice expanse regulates the planet's temperature, as the white surface reflects the Sun's energy back into the atmosphere and also cools the water beneath and near it.Without its ice cooling the planet, Antarctica could transform from Earth's refrigerator to a radiator, experts say.The ice that floats on the Antarctic Ocean's surface now measures less than 17 million sq km - that is 1.5 million sq km of sea-ice less than the September average, and well below previous winter record lows.That's an area of missing ice about five times the size of the British Isles.Dr Meier is not optimistic that the sea-ice will recover to a significant degree.Scientists are still trying to identify all the factors that led to this year's low sea-ice - but studying trends in Antarctica has historically been challenging.In a year when several global heat and ocean temperature records have broken, some scientists insist the low sea-ice is the measure to pay attention to."We can see how much more vulnerable it is," says Dr Robbie Mallett, of the University of Manitoba, who is based on the Antarctic peninsula.Already braving isolation, extreme cold and powerful winds, this year's thin sea-ice has made his team's work even more difficult. "There is a risk that it breaks off and drifts out to sea with us on it," Dr Mallett says.Sea-ice forms in the continent's winter (March to October) before largely melting in summer, and is part of an interconnected system that also consists of icebergs, land ice and huge ice shelves - floating extensions of land ice jutting out from the coast.Sea-ice acts as a protective sleeve for the ice covering the land and prevents the ocean from heating up.Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey explains that the impacts of shrinking sea-ice may become evident as the season transitions to summer - when there's potential for an unstoppable feedback loop of ice melting.As more sea-ice disappears, it exposes dark areas of ocean, which absorb sunlight instead of reflecting it, meaning that the heat energy is added into the water, which in turn melts more ice. Scientists call this the ice-albedo effect.That could add a lot more heat to the planet, disrupting Antarctica's usual role as a regulator of global temperatures."Are we awakening this giant of Antarctica?" asks Prof Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at the University of Exeter. It would be "an absolute disaster for the world," he says.There are signs that what is already happening to Antarctica's ice sheets is in the worst-case scenario range of what was predicted, says Prof Anna Hogg, an Earth scientist at the University of Leeds.Since the 1990s, the loss of land ice from Antarctica has contributed 7.2mm to sea-level rise.Even modest increases in sea levels can result in dangerously high storm surges that could wipe out coastal communities. If significant amounts of land ice were to start melting, the impacts would be catastrophic for millions of people around the world.As a self-contained continent surrounded by water, Antarctica has its own weather and climate system. Until 2016 Antarctica's winter sea-ice had actually been growing in size.But in March 2022 an extreme heatwave hit East Antarctica, pushing temperatures to -10C when they should have been closer to -50C."When I started studying the Antarctic 30 years ago, we never thought extreme weather events could happen there," says Prof Siegert.Sea-ice has broken record minimums in summer for three of the past seven years, including February 2023.Some scientists even believe these low ice records may indicate a fundamental change is happening to the continent - a shift in the conditions which have kept the region insulated.Antarctica's remoteness and shortage of historical information means a lot is still unknown.The region is still the "Wild West" in scientific terms, according to Dr Robbie Mallett.Scientists know how far the sea-ice spreads, but not, for instance, how thick it is. Unlocking that puzzle could radically change climate models for the region.At the scientific base Rothera, Dr Mallett is using radar instruments to study sea-ice thickness for an international research project called Defiant.He and other scientists are still trying to disentangle the causes of the vanishing winter ice."There is a chance that it's a really freak expression of natural variability," he says, meaning that lots of natural factors could have built up and are affecting the region simultaneously.This year's record-warm oceans are likely a contributing factor, scientists suggest - warm water will not freeze.And there may have also been changes in ocean currents and the winds that drive temperatures in the Antarctic.The El Niño weather phenomenon, currently developing in the Pacific, could also be subtly contributing to shrinking sea-ice, although it is still weak.Dr Mallett says there are "very, very good reasons to be worried"."It's potentially a really alarming sign of Antarctic climate change that hasn't been there for the last 40 years. And it's only just emerging now."© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

Headline: Britain's impossible dilemma over China's electric cars
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66820791
Content:
The UK is facing a dilemma: should it fight the rising imports of Chinese electric cars with big new tariffs, in the same way the EU has threatened to do this week? Or should it allow them to continue? Keeping open to the imports in would make it easier for the UK to hit its goal of no new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and it would make electric cars cheaper. But the UK car industry could be damaged.The British car industry is showing off its green electric future at a Bedfordshire racetrack, and behind the marques, some familiar, some less so, there is a new force.China is cornering the market in electric vehicles.A friendly man from Chinese firm BYD shows me the Atto."We're really proud of this car," says Mark Blundell. "It's new to the market, and packed full of technology. In simple terms we can pack 50% more battery into less space."The car's interior is inspired by a gym. It has a heat pump as standard, vegan leather, and strings on the door map-pocket tight enough to "get a tune out of". The display screen on the dashboard rotates at the press of a button.For now, hands should still be on the steering wheel, though China expects to be ahead of the game on autonomous driving too.And the all important battery life and range? Impressive.China has cornered the market in electric vehicle batteries. Indeed, many of the new car companies, including Byd, started off as battery manufacturers.BYD stands for "Build Your Dreams", and they are on course to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles this year. If hybrids are included, they are already number one.BYD, long-backed by legendary US investor Warren Buffett, has just started selling in the UK, and recently wooed the Munich motor show with six models heading for Europe.Other Chinese brands, such as FunkyCat and Nio, are not yet as well known in Europe.There are also more-established brands, such as the Volvo-linked Polestar, and the formerly Oxford-based MG cars, which are being shipped from China.Moreover, most Teslas in the UK in recent years have been shipped from China, made in the Shanghai Gigafactory that was built in six months in 2019.In total, China has already overtaken Germany for overall global car exports, and will overtake Japan this year, becoming the world's top exporter, according to figures from Moody's Analytics.This is no accident according to Andy Palmer, the former Aston Martin and Nissan boss."Twenty years ago, I was sitting on the board of [Chinese carmaker] Dongfeng. It was the decree of the Chinese government that Chinese car companies needed to leapfrog over western companies and the best way of doing that was to adopt new energy vehicles, as they called them at the time. That ultimately, of course, meant battery-electric vehicles," he says.That strategic planning for dominance in this sector meant China carved up capability on batteries, motors and the raw materials supply chains stretching across the world.Now the scale they have, combined with subsidies, mean Chinese manufacturers are able to undercut other global players, Mr Palmer says.It is also important to note that there are fundamental differences between the production of an electric vehicle and a conventional combustion engine car.Much more of the car's value is in the battery, compared to the value of the engine in relation to the rest of the car.The technology and transmission is more straightforward too. If you have the batteries, it is far easier to add wheels and the technology around it.Companies like BYD are ahead of the game when it comes to innovative battery technology, and are achieving ranges of as much as 400 miles without the use of cobalt and nickel. Both rare metals pose acute supply and environmental challenges, cobalt thanks to its connection with conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nickel given its dependence on Russia.But the bottom line is that the cars perform well and look the part, being sold at competitive prices.As Jon Bentley, author of Autopia and presenter of the Gadget Show says: "[Chinese imports] could really change the European market quite considerably in a way the Japanese car industry did in the 70s and 80s."Given that it's the price that is stopping many of us adopting electric cars, they are potentially a huge market force that we're about to discover being unleashed upon us".Eliminating new combustion engine vehicles over the next decade is the single biggest contributor to the government's path to net zero. So cheaper Chinese models could play a big role in the same way cheaper solar panels did.On the other hand, even if tariffs are applied to Chinese imports, the European and British car industry may struggle to compete.A car industry veteran told me earlier this year that Chinese firms were "sewing up the dealerships".Chinese companies have chosen to expand their exports into Europe and the rest of the world, but not into the US.So it was striking and inevitable that the European Union announced a new probe into Chinese electric vehicles this week.The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they had not forgotten how the solar industry was affected by China's "unfair trade practices"."Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily-subsidised Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market," she said.In the industry, this is seen as a mainly French push, with the Germans a little more sceptical.German industry is more invested in tie-ups with Chinese industry and its premium brands stand to suffer the most if what began this week escalates into a trade war.The Chinese government hit back, calling the investigation "a naked protectionist act".The process takes just over a year, and could lead to extra, even punitive tariffs, levied on car imports into Europe.It raises the question of what might happen here in the UK.The independent Trade Remedies Authority, the post-Brexit organisation responsible for assessing unfair trade, said it has "invited" carmakers to make a complaint and supply data showing harm done by subsidised Chinese electric vehicles.Neither the industry body, nor individual carmakers have done so, so far.But some in the industry say that if the EU were to apply punitive tariffs, then China's export drive could be refocused on the UK.The government does reserve some powers to act on trade defence issues.It is intriguing that the Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch did this week cite competition from China in her push to get the EU to delay the Brexit trade deal restrictions on the electric vehicle trade.But there is an extra twist on this issue for carmakers in Britain, which some privately describe as "farcical".In a few weeks' time the government will introduce its Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, designed to force carmakers down the path towards hitting targets to eliminate the sale of the combustion engine.If a car company misses its target that 22% of its sales are electric, starting in January, it will either face fines of £15,000 per vehicle, or have to buy a surplus credit from a company that has sold lots of electric vehicles.It happens to be the case that the Chinese-made import brands are mainly all electric.The net result of all this, fear some in the car industry, is a system where existing UK manufacturers, including of hybrid cars, will pay thousands of pounds to subsidise electric imports.Essentially, UK factories, which face competition from Chinese electric imports, could have to subsidise them.While this is not the intention of the policy it could be the inadvertent effect.The government has not yet published its response to a consultation on this that closed four months ago.The expectation in the industry is that sufficient flexibilities will be introduced to prevent this issue.But the system is just weeks away from being introduced. And it is clear that the general architecture of the ZEV mandate is designed to provide a carrot for electric importers, including from China, and a stick for actual producers of existing cars in the UK.Right now, the EU is looking at restricting Chinese electric vehicle sales, whereas the UK could inadvertently be subsidising them.Is this part of a conscious post-Brexit strategy to help the British consumer, with an anti-protectionist free trade approach? Does the route to mass adoption of zero carbon technologies go through Shanghai?None of this is happening in a vacuum. Apart from the commercial challenge, many in Parliament are distinctly uneasy about aiding Chinese dominance in a sector as totemic and strategic as the automotive industry.Are cars different from TVs and Iphones, or more like semi-conductors, 5G infrastructure and energy?The strategic question is how China cleaned up with two decades of long-term planning on electric cars and their batteries, on a clear and predictable consequence of a net zero agenda pushed by the G7 western nations.The more immediate question for Britain is whether we go for cheaper Chinese imports to aid mass adoption of a key net zero technology, or prioritise domestic production.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: UN calls for radical changes to slow warming

Tackling climate change needs a rapid transformation of the way our world works, travels, eats and uses energy, according to an important UN review.This is the first "global stocktake" to examine the efforts of countries to reduce planet-warming emissions since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.While progress has been made, efforts now need to be massively scaled up.The report calls for "radical decarbonisation" with a fast phase out of fossil fuels without carbon capture.Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide, which is the main driver of climate change. Carbon capture in industrial processes and power stations stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either reuses it or stores it underground.Renewable energy also needs significant expansion while deforestation needs to be halted and reversed by 2030.The stocktake report will be considered by political leaders and will be central to global climate talks in Dubai later this year.Over the course of the past two years, the UN has set out to review the promises made by countries who signed the Paris agreement in 2015. At the meeting eight years ago, countries agreed to keep the amount of warming since the industrial revolution well below 2C and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C.The report examines their efforts to cut carbon, to adapt to climate change and how they have mobilised finance and technology to help poorer nations deal with the problem.No country is named and shamed in this report, which considers the collective approach to tackling the problem.Much progress has been made, the document acknowledges, but the global rise in temperatures predicted for this century is still well above what was promised in Paris.Keeping to those goals will now require a significant uptick in ambition according to the stocktake, which calls for widespread "system transformation".This means that every aspect of our societies needs to change to rein in rising temperatures.This includes the way we make energy, the way we travel, work and produce food.  Experts say this type of change needs governments to take the initiative and make sure that their climate actions aren't immediately nullified by other policies and investments."One could also see the call for system transformations as a recognition that, while we still can, we should take our destiny in our own hands," said Dr Richard Klein from the Stockholm Environment Institute, who was involved in the initial stages of the stocktake."Either we transform society in a way that avoids the worst of climate change, or climate change will transform society for us, in ways that are difficult to foresee but likely not to be very pleasant."The report makes a clear call for the rapid scaling up of renewable energy sources including wind and solar but also says that fossil fuels that don't capture the carbon they produce have no future.  The stocktake says that these are "indispensable elements" of a just transition to net zero by the middle of this century.Electric vehicles "offer the greatest mitigation potential" in the transport sector, according to the report which also underlines the fact that shifting to climate friendly, healthy diets, reducing food waste and fostering sustainable agriculture can make a significant difference to limiting emissions.The stocktake also examines efforts on climate adaptation and finance, something that has been a constant source of anger for developing countries. It calls for a rapid scaling up of finance from an expanded range of sources.The idea of a stocktake is to ensure that the next set of plans to cut carbon that governments register with the UN in 2025 will be more ambitious than the current ones.However the report will also form the basis of discussions at the COP28 global climate talks to be held in Dubai later this year.Efforts at COP27 to agree a phase out of all unabated fossil fuels failed due to resistance from several major oil producing nations.UN officials believe the stocktake report will increase the pressure for a major statement at COP28."I urge governments to carefully study the findings of the report and ultimately understand what it means for them and the ambitious action they must take next," said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change.Observers agree that the document is a wake-up call."We already know the world is failing to meet its climate goals, but leaders now have a concrete blueprint underpinned by a mountain of evidence for how to get the job done,"  said Ani Dasgupta from the World Resources Institute.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: No bids for offshore wind in government auction
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66749344
Content:
No new offshore wind project contracts have been bought by developers at a key government auction, dealing a blow to the UK's renewable power strategy.Results showed no bids for new offshore wind farms, but there were deals for solar, tidal and onshore wind projects.Firms have argued the price set for electricity generated was too low to make offshore wind projects viable.The government said a "global rise" in inflation impacting supply chains had "presented challenges for projects".It said while offshore and floating offshore wind projects did not feature on the agreed deals list, the outcome was "in line with similar results in countries including Germany and Spain".The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said "significant numbers" of solar power, onshore wind, tidal energy schemes, and for the first time, geothermal projects, which use heat from the ground to generate power, had been awarded funding.But the lack of offshore wind will be a blow to the pledge to deliver 50 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 compared with 14GW today.Renewable energy groups have said that alternative renewable projects, such as solar, cannot do the heavy lifting in generating the power that offshore wind does.The technology has been described as the "jewel in the UK's renewable energy crown", but firms have been hit by higher costs for building offshore farms, with materials such as steel and labour being more expensive.The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and is home to the world's four largest farms, supporting tens of thousands of jobs, which provided 13.8% of the UK's electricity generation last year, according to government statistics.The government's annual auction invites companies to bid to develop renewable energy projects and contracts to supply the UK grid with electricity. The scheme ensures projects receive a guaranteed price from the government for the electricity they will generate, which it is hoped will enable companies to have the confidence to invest.The deal, called a Contract for Difference (CFD), means if electricity prices are above the price set, the companies pay the excess back to energy suppliers, which should help to cut bills. If prices fall below the guaranteed price the energy suppliers - and customers - pay the company the difference.It was hoped offshore wind in the latest round could have helped generate five gigawatts of power, enough to run five million homes, but wind farm builders had warned for months that the government was not taking into account how much the costs of developing them had soared.Industry insiders told the BBC that the £44 per megawatt hour price floor set for the latest auction failed to take account of higher costs.Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the outcome of the auction was a "multi-billion pound lost opportunity to deliver low-cost energy for consumers and a wake-up call for government".He said the contracts had been "recognised globally as a lynchpin of the UK's offshore success", but said "the economics simply did not stand up this time around"."We need to get back on track and consider how we unlock the billions of investment in what is still one of the cheapest ways to generate power and meet the UK's long-term offshore wind ambitions for the future," he added.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, which is currently building the world's largest offshore wind farm, said offshore wind power was a much cheaper energy source and about half the price compared with other sources including fossil fuels.But he told the BBC's Today programme that while the UK needed to build more wind farms, "for this particular auction unfortunately the prices were just set too low" for electricity generated to make  investment viable.On Friday, wholesale gas prices in the UK rose by about 10% after strike action kicked off at two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Australia.Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow energy security and net zero secretary, said the result of the auction was an "absolute disaster for Britain", but should have been avoidable. He argued the government had been warned by the industry that "unless they adjusted the auction price this would happen"."They [the government] should be hanging their heads in shame," he told the BBC's Today programme.While there were no bids for offshore contracts, the government said a total of 95 clean energy projects had secured funding of £227m, up from 93 in the previous auction, securing "enough to power the equivalent of two million homes".Energy and Climate Change Minister Graham Stuart said the government was "delighted" that the auction had "seen a record number of successful projects across solar, onshore wind, tidal power and, for the first time, geo-thermal".He added that offshore wind was "central to our ambitions to decarbonise our electricity supply", and said the government would  "work with industry to make sure we retain our global leadership in this vital technology".© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Has Australia cleaned up its act on climate?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-65606208
Content:
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came to power last year promising the country would leave the climate "naughty corner".Long considered a laggard, Australia would now cut emissions, become a renewable energy powerhouse and force the biggest polluters to clean up their act, the new leader declared."I want to join the global effort," Mr Albanese told the BBC, minutes after his victory speech.It is now a year since he legislated Australia's first ever emissions reduction target - so, has he delivered?Until recently, acknowledging and tackling climate change proved a hugely contentious issue in Australia - famously playing a role in toppling three prime ministers in a decade.The country is one of the world's biggest polluters per head of population, and it has failed to make any significant cuts to its core emissions despite signing up to global pledges.But Australia is also a nation where the effects of climate change have become devastatingly obvious.In 2022 - the so-called "climate election" - there was a historic surge in support for candidates pledging urgent action, and the issue was a major factor in the demise of yet another prime minister, Scott Morrison, whose conservative government had been in power for nine years."Together we can end the climate wars," Mr Albanese said at the time.The election of his government made a huge, overnight difference to Australia's international standing, experts say.Many world leaders expressed relief at - or alluded to - the fact Australia had a new leader who appeared serious on climate change.Fiji's then PM Frank Bainimarama, whose country is among the most at risk from rising seas, welcomed Australia's plan to "put the climate first", while the UK's Boris Johnson said he looked forward with working with Mr Albanese on making the world a "better" and "greener" place.Professor Mark Howden - a vice chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - noted a change in attitude among the science and business communities too."I used to get accosted by people at conferences… people were sort of critiquing Australia's position and wondering why we weren't doing more," he tells the BBC."These days, they're very welcoming."Mr Albanese's government has enshrined into law an emissions cut target of 43% by 2030, up from 26-28%. That difference is equivalent to eliminating emissions from Australia's entire transport or agriculture sectors.It has also negotiated the introduction of a key plank of its plan to achieve that goal - a "safeguard mechanism" that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters."[That] was really the first new piece of legislation aimed to actually driving down emissions in Australia for more than a decade," Climate Council researcher Simon Bradshaw tells the BBC."We've got ourselves back in the game."The government is also looking to incentivise emissions cuts on a consumer level, through things like an electric vehicle policy that is still to be detailed.Public concern over the government's actions on climate change has fallen - 31% of Australians believe they are doing too little, down from 44% the year before, when the Morrison government was in power.But there's still "an appropriate level of cynicism" towards Australia and its climate efforts, experts say.Its new 2030 target is not enough to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by 1.1C but experts say they're optimistic that dramatic and rapid changes can still save the planet.However Australia's target is also weaker than many of its international peers, such as the US or UK."We're not laggards anymore, but neither are we leaders," Prof Howden says.Critics are chiefly concerned that the government has refused to outlaw new coal, oil and gas projects.New projects will not just be a hurdle for domestic emissions targets. It is the global implication that is most grim - Australia is one of the world's biggest fossil fuel exporters.The IPCC says new fossil fuel projects are not compatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement, and in fact, existing infrastructure must be urgently phased out.But the Australian government has already greenlit three new coal mine projects - including one just last week.That Australia persists with new fossil fuel projects despite declaring a new era on climate is "extremely reckless" and "no doubt confusing" to others across the globe, Dr Bradshaw says."There are questions being asked by our international peers, as they should be," he says."The science here is unequivocal… it compels us to leave our fossil fuels in the ground. Every new project that is developed and every tonne of carbon we burn is pushing us closer to catastrophe."Experts say there is still plenty more the government could - and must - do to drive its emissions down.At the top of those calls is a comprehensive price on greenhouse gas emissions, like those in place in the UK, Canada and Scandinavia."Almost every economist across the globe would say [that] is the best and most efficient way of reducing emissions," says Prof Howden."In an ideal world, that would be what we do next [but] we're living in a world where politics has made that a toxic ground to occupy," he says, referring to a carbon tax furore that played a big role in the downfall of former Australian leader Julia Gillard in 2013.A carbon price isn't part of the government's official climate policy, and Mr Albanese has previously suggested such a measure wouldn't be necessary anymore thanks to cheaper renewable energy.But there's room for improvement there too, experts say.Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, and is surrounded by seas which could be used for hydro-electric power. But currently only about 30% of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources - significantly below than the UK, for example, which is far less blessed with natural resources.Australia's government has a lofty goal of making that 82% by the end of the decade. It envisages this will both drive down emissions and enable Australia to replace fossil fuel exports.Others like Dr Bradshaw and the Greens party say reform to Australia's environment laws so that they factor in the climate impacts of developments is desperately needed, pointing to recent mine approvals.So while there is renewed optimism overall, so far there's little actual progress in emissions cuts themselves.With 2030 now only seven years away, the country's emissions have dropped by about 21% against the 2005 benchmark it set, according to government figures.But that is mainly because it is cutting down fewer trees - which capture and store carbon. That's something expert say often hides true emission trends.In reality, the country's gross emissions have barely budged - dropping by just 1.5%."Having lost many years, we're really just at the start of this journey… it does take time to turn the ship around. We can meet those targets… but it does mean accomplishing a lot early on in this decade," Dr Bradshaw says.This video can not be playedWATCH: New Australian PM says climate action "shouldn't be controversial"© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Earth in uncharted waters as climate records tumble

Content:
A series of climate records on temperature, ocean heat, and Antarctic sea ice have alarmed some scientists who say their speed and timing is unprecedented.Dangerous heatwaves in Europe could break further records, the UN says.It is hard to immediately link these events to climate change because weather - and oceans - are so complex.Studies are under way, but scientists already fear some worst-case scenarios are unfolding."I'm not aware of a similar period when all parts of the climate system were in record-breaking or abnormal territory," Thomas Smith, an environmental geographer at London School of Economics, says."The Earth is in uncharted territory" now due to global warming from burning fossil fuels, as well as heat from the first El Niño - a warming natural weather system - since 2018, says Imperial College London climate science lecturer Dr Paulo Ceppi.Here are four climate records broken so far this summer - the hottest day on record, the hottest June on record globally, extreme marine heatwaves, record-low Antarctic sea-ice - and what they tell us.The world experienced its hottest day ever recorded in July, breaking the global average temperature record set in 2016.Average global temperature topped 17C for the first time, reaching 17.08C on 6 July, according to EU climate monitoring service Copernicus.Ongoing emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, coal, and gas are behind the planet's warming trend.This is exactly what was forecast to happen in a world warmed by more greenhouse gases, says climate scientist Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College London."Humans are 100% behind the upward trend," she says."If I'm surprised by anything, it's that we're seeing the records broken in June, so earlier in the year. El Niño normally doesn't really have a global impact until five or six months into the phase," Dr Smith says.El Niño is the world's most powerful naturally occurring climate fluctuation. It brings warmer water to the surface in the tropical Pacific, pushing warmer air into the atmosphere. It normally increases global air temperatures.The average global temperature in June this year was 1.47C above the typical June in the pre-industrial period. Humans started pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when the Industrial Revolution started around 1800.Asked if summer 2023 is what he would have forecasted a decade ago, Dr Smith says that climate models are good at predicting long-term trends but less good at forecasting the next 10 years."Models from the 1990s pretty much put us where we are today. But to have an idea about what the next 10 years would look like exactly would be very difficult," he says."Things aren't going to cool down," he adds.The average global ocean temperature has smashed records for May, June and July. It is approaching the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded, which was in 2016.But it is extreme heat in the North Atlantic ocean that is particularly alarming scientists."We've never ever had a marine heatwave in this part of Atlantic. I had not expected this," says Daniela Schmidt, Prof of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.In June temperatures off the west coast of Ireland were between 4C and 5C above average, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified as a category 5 heatwave, or "beyond extreme".Directly attributing this heatwave to climate change is complex, but that work is ongoing, Prof Schmidt says.What is clear is that the world has warmed and the oceans have absorbed most of that heat from the atmosphere, she explains."Our models have natural variability in them, and there are still things appearing that we had not envisaged, or at least not yet," she adds.She emphasises the impact of this heat on marine ecosystems, which produce 50% of the world's oxygen."People tend to think about trees and grasses dying when we talk about heatwaves. The Atlantic is 5C warmer than it should be - that means organisms need 50% more food just to function as normal," she says.The area covered by sea-ice in the Antarctic is at record lows for July. There is an area around 10 times the size of the UK missing, compared with the 1981-2010 average.Alarm bells are ringing for scientists as they try to unpick the exact link to climate change.A warming world could reduce levels of Antarctic sea-ice, but the current dramatic reduction could also be due to local weather conditions or ocean currents, explains Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey.She emphasises it is not just a record being broken - it is being smashed by a long way."This is nothing like anything we've seen before in July. It's 10% lower than the previous low, which is huge."She calls it "another sign that we don't really understand the pace of change".Scientists believed that global warming would affect Antarctic sea-ice at some point, but until 2015 it bucked the global trend for other oceans, Dr Holmes says."You can say that we've fallen off a cliff, but we don't know what's at the bottom of the cliff here," she says."I think this has taken us by surprise in terms of the speed of which has happened. It's definitely not the best case scenario that we were looking at - it's closer to the worst case," she says.We can certainly expect more and more of these records to break as the year goes on and we enter 2024, scientists say.But it would be wrong to call what is happening a "climate collapse" or "runaway warming", cautions Dr Otto.We are in a new era, but "we still have time to secure a liveable future for many", she explains.Additional reporting by Mark Poynting and Becky Dale© 2023 BBC.

Headline: UK no longer a world leader on climate - watchdog
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66032607
Content:
Government backing for new oil and coal, airport expansion plans and slow progress on heat pumps show that the UK has lost its leadership on climate issues, a government watchdog warns.The Climate Change Committee (CCC) described government efforts to scale up climate action as "worryingly slow".It was "markedly" less confident than a year ago that the UK would reach its targets for cutting carbon emissions.The government said it was committed to its climate targets.Committee chairman Lord Deben, a former Conservative environment minister, was particularly critical of the government's policy on new coal and oil projects.The decision to approve the UK's first new deep coal mine in 30 years in Cumbria last December was "total nonsense", he told the BBC.Lord Deben was also damning about plans for a major new oilfield off the coast of Scotland. Approval for Rosebank, which could produce an estimated 300 million barrels of oil in its lifetime, is expected soon."How can we ask countries in Africa not to develop oil?" Lord Deben said. "How can we ask other nations not to expand the fossil fuel production if we start doing it ourselves?"The UK has set legally binding targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning the country will no longer contribute any additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.At the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 then prime minister Boris Johnson vowed to cut emissions by 68% on 1990 levels by the end of the decade.The CCC report warned "continued delays in policy development and implementation" meant reaching them was "increasingly challenging".The Committee highlighted a "lack of urgency" across government and a "worrying hesitancy" by ministers to lead on the climate issue.Minister of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Graham Stuart said in response to the report that the government had met all its carbon targets to date and was confident of doing so in the future.Responding to criticism for continued support for oil and gas projects, he stressed that despite an unprecedented role for renewables, the UK would remain dependent on these sources for power generation for the foreseeable future."There is no button I can press tomorrow, and as we will be dependent on oil and gas for decades to come, even as we move to net zero, it makes sense that we should produce it here," he told journalists.Regarding the new coal mine in Cumbria, he stressed that it would produce coking coal for making steel, not for energy production and that there was currently no alternative.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics for Greenpeace UK called the report "a pitiful catalogue of Rishi Sunak's climate failures"."This report exposes the catastrophic negligence shown by this government which has left Britain with higher bills, fewer good jobs, our energy security weakened, and the climate emergency unaddressed," said Labour's Shadow Climate and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband.The chair of the COP26 summit, Alok Sharma, agreed the UK was at risk of losing what he called its "international reputation and influence on climate".He said the country risked falling behind without a response to initiatives like the US's vast subsidies for green industries."Resting on our laurels is definitely not the answer industry is seeking," he said, one of the sharpest criticisms the Conservative MP has made of the government's climate policy.More needs to be done to encourage us all to install heat pumps, insulate our homes, reduce how much meat we eat and fly less, the Committee said.At the same time, it said, the switch to renewable power needs to be ramped up, industry needs more help to decarbonise and there needs to be a huge increase in the numbers of trees planted and the speed of peatland restoration.The report acknowledged that glimmers of the Net Zero transition can be seen in growing sales of electric cars and the growing renewable power sector.But it warned the government continues to rely on unproven technological solutions rather than "more straightforward" encouragement of people to reduce high-carbon activities.The Committee says the government should be doing more to encourage us to fly less rather than relying on the development of sustainable fuels to reduce the carbon emissions from aviation, for example.It pointed out that lots of UK airports are planning to expand capacity despite a CCC recommendation that there should be no net airport expansion. Seven out of the 10 major UK airports have plans to expand, according to BBC research.Lord Deben, whose second and final term as chair of the CCC ends this month, said that one of the government's biggest failures was not putting net zero at the heart of the UK's planning system."If you pass laws in order to do something and then don't provide the means, then you're failing," he told the BBC.He said he was sad his final report "does not show satisfactory progress".UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 46% from 1990 levels, the CCC says, largely thanks to a massive reduction in the use of coal for electricity and the growth of the renewable power sector.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Mediterranean-style wildfire fighting coming to UK
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65848872
Content:
Firefighters will deploy new techniques  learnt in the world's worst wildfire hotspots as climate change raises the risk level in the UK this summer.Last year's heatwaves saw thousands of fires break out, with one destroying homes at Wennington, east London.This year has already seen hundreds of grass fires and one of the UK's largest ever has been burning near Cannich in Scotland for the past two weeks.More fire crews are now training in skills from southern Europe and the US.Fire chiefs are particularly looking to expand the number of specialist teams trained in "burn suppression" techniques - the deliberate burning of land to keep a fire contained.At the moment, just five UK units across more than 50 fire and rescue services specialise in the "fighting fire with fire" technique, mostly in moorland areas.With more than 90 buildings destroyed by wildfires close to urban areas last July, more units - including those in services that straddle urban and rural areas - would be trained in new ways of wildfire fighting.They could then be deployed nationally, in the event of a significant fire.Chief Fire Officer Paul Hedley, wildfire lead for the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), said the risk and threat of such major wildfires was "clearly growing in the UK"."All of this learning from international partners, who are probably still some years ahead of us, is a very sensible way of trying to get us ahead of the curve," he said.It is hoped a UK-wide training programme will be set up as part of a national action plan drawn up in response to the lessons learnt from last year's blazes.One of the services leading the way is Surrey Fire and Rescue, which has already dealt with more than 80 wildfires this year.The most recent wildfire was last month at Frensham Common, near Farnham, a popular beauty spot.The cause of the 10-hectare fire is not yet known - but the damage is clear to see.Where once there was rich heathland, home to rare species, including sand lizards, there is now desolation.When the BBC visited, volunteers from the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation charity were walking the scorched earth, stretched out in a line like a police forensics team, searching for creatures that survived the blaze.If the immediate impact is shocking, the long-term effects are equally concerning."Whilst we can save some of these animals that survived the fire, we lose an awful lot and we lose all that biodiversity. It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again," explained trustee Howard Inns.For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take."To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll," he said.Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come."Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition," he explained. "What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now."We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out."Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread.Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: "Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction."The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around £2.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.A spokesperson said: "The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them."© 2023 BBC.

Headline: What does net zero mean?

Content:
PM Rishi Sunak has announced plans to weaken some of the government's green commitments.This includes delaying a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, as well as scrapping policies that would force landlords to upgrade efficiency in their homes.Even before these latest changes, the UK was being criticised for falling behind in its efforts to reach "net zero" by 2050, a key international target intended to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill.These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries - including the UK - agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100.To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.However, the UN wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called "the growing climate disaster".Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as "offsetting".Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.On 20 September, Rishi Sunak announced major changes to the UK's approach to the net zero target, including:Mr Sunak denied he was "watering down" the government's net zero commitments, and insisted the UK was on course to reach its target by 2050, saying that a "more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach" was needed.Labour said the prime minister had "sold out the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century" for Britain "to lead the world in transition to well-paid secured new jobs of the green economy".There was also a mixed reaction from within his own party, as well as among business leaders, with some calling it a "mis-step" while others described the announcement as pragmatic.The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards achieving net zero by 2050.While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.This could include:Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for "carbon neutrality" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies.The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself.But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels.But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.© 2023 BBC.

Content:
Global temperatures are rising as a result of human activity.People around the world are already experiencing the consequences, from more intense heatwaves to rising sea levels.Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue that urgent action can still avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The climate has fluctuated naturally throughout the world's history.But scientists say that there is no doubt that the particularly rapid climate change seen over the past century is caused by humans.In particular they say it is due to the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport.When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat in the atmosphere, causing the planet's temperature to rise.Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of these fuels - the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by over 50%, and is still growing.As a result of the increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane, the world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the late 19th century.A global average temperature increase of 1.1C might not sound much, but it has already had a huge effect on the environment. Impacts so far include:People's lives are already changing as a result. For example, the ongoing East African drought has put more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger. The 2022 European heatwaves led to an abnormal increase in deaths.Extreme weather events have caused trillions of dollars of economic damage in recent decades, but the death toll has actually fallen as early warning systems have improved, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.Scientists say limiting temperature rise to 1.5C is crucial to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change - although these increase with every extra increment of warming.The 1.5C warming limit was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called "tipping points".These are thresholds beyond which changes could accelerate and become irreversible in different parts of the Earth's climate system, such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.But it's not clear precisely where these thresholds sit. Some may have already been crossed; some may be further away than first thought.The science is not completely certain, but the impacts of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could include:About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are classed as being highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC.People living in developing countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt.This has led to questions about fairness, because these places have typically contributed only a small percentage of the greenhouse gases which caused climate change in the first place.However, impacts in one place can have knock-on effects for all regions. For instance, people being displaced from one area could lead to mass migrations, and crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise global food prices.In a landmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.To achieve this, scientists said that countries should achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Net zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.Most countries have, or are considering, net zero targets, but many of these are dated after 2050.Real-world action has been slow, and the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still rising.As a result, UN scientists believe the world is "likely" to warm beyond 1.5C based on current government targets.World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments. The next summit (COP28) will be held in the UAE in November and December 2023.Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say small changes from individuals can also make a difference:Top image from Getty Images.

Every year countries pledge to cut their greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to curb the impacts of climate change.But still global temperatures keep rising.In May, scientists announced that average global temperatures would probably pass the 1.5C threshold for the first time in the next five years. As temperatures rise the world will see more devastating heatwaves, wildfires and floods.Find out using the interactive chart below which countries are on track with their commitments to meet the Paris climate goal of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5 degrees.The graphic shows how each country should be reducing emissions to line up with global climate commitments, considering their resources and technology available.However, the pathways do not take into account historical emissions that countries have released.Developed nations such as the UK began building factories and manufacturing earlier than other nations. Fossil fuels were used in the process and these countries began producing significant greenhouse gas emissions from the mid 19th Century.Developing countries argue that it is fair for developed countries, who have emitted more greenhouse gases, and therefore contributed more to the issue of climate change, to reduce their emissions quicker and harder.Developed nations also benefited financially from industrialising earlier, and it is argued they should therefore use more resources to tackle the issue.'Fair share' pathways are an alternative to the pathways in the graph above. They take into account these historical issues.There is no international agreement on what a fair level of contribution would be for each country to cut their emissions. But in the global 2015 Paris Agreement countries did recognise they have a shared responsibility to tackle climate change but have different capabilities.Using more than 40 studies from the UN's climate scientists group, the IPCC, researchers at Climate Action Tracker have created a set of 'fair share' emissions pathways to get each country to align with the 1.5 degree Paris goal.Their research on fair shares is illustrated in the chart below.Saudi Arabia's most recent pledges could yield a range of emissions, according to the Climate Action Tracker. Emissions from its current policies could fall within the range of pledged emissions, but would still be higher than the midpoint shown in the chart above.Additional reporting by Becky Dale and Esme Stallard.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: What you can do to reduce carbon emissions

Content:
Tackling climate change will require world leaders to take action on a global level.But as individuals we also contribute to warming emissions. Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact.From installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there is a raft of changes around the home that can help the planet."Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference," according to Dr Neil Jennings, an academic from Imperial College London."On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change."The UK government currently offers grants of £5,000 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs until 2025.This video can not be playedBBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprintImproving insulation in our walls, ceilings and windows can reduce the loss of heat from our homes and the amount of energy needed to heat them.Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of insulation, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows, doors or skirting boards.The EST estimates that draught-proofing could save £125 a year on average household bills.Switching to a green energy provider or a green tariff can significantly reduce your household's carbon footprint. But a recent increase in wholesale energy prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means many providers have withdrawn their offers.Livestock creates 14% of all greenhouse gases globally, with cattle being by far the largest contributor.The simplest and most effective way to limit your impact is to reduce meat and dairy in your diet, particularly red meat such as lamb and beef.Good news for vegans, obviously - but there are other considerations to take into account.It's not just a question of "tagging individual products as good or bad", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen.She says the carbon footprint of any given food also depends on how it is produced, where it comes from and whether it's in season.Dr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home.The world wastes between 25% and 30% of its food, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme. Between 8-10% of global carbon emissions are linked to unconsumed produce, according to a UN report.This video can not be playedClimate Basics: CO2 explainedTransport is responsible for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions.Living car-free might be "the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions," according to Dr Jennings.However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled.Small steps still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours.Electric cars are becoming more widespread, but they are still prohibitively expensive for some people and charging infrastructure is limited in places.Unfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals.Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre.Train journeys can have less than a fifth of the impact of a domestic flight, although they might be more expensive. Booking in advance can help reduce the cost."For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint," says Dr Jennings.It takes 3,781 litres of water to make one pair of jeans, according to the UN's Environment Programme, taking into account cotton production, manufacture, transport and washing.You can limit your impact by repairing minor faults in clothing rather than replacing them, donating rather than throwing away and choosing higher-quality items that you think will last longer.An increasing number of companies are offering clothes to rent, which helps reduce waste in the fashion industry. You could also try buying second-hand.Choosing the right household appliances can also have a positive effect on your carbon footprint. Dr Jennings suggests making sure you are buying the most energy-efficient products, such as washing machines, when they need replacing.This video can not be playedDeforestation: What’s wrong with planting new forests?© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Farmers not 'out of woods' after meat tax rejected
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-66883028
Content:
A farmer has warned her industry still faces major challenges despite Rishi Sunak's rejection of a meat tax.Laura Corbett, a livestock farmer in Wiltshire, said her business was penalised by regulations made by "misinformed people in government".She argued that farmers "had the tools" to help tackle climate change but they need more support from government.Farming Minister Mark Spencer said there were a number of new schemes in place to support the industry.On Wednesday the prime minister ruled out proposals for a meat tax as he set out changes to the UK's green policies.Ms Corbett, who runs a business called the Gourmet Goat Farmer, said farmers were needed to steward the countryside to lessen the damage being done by climate change."We want to reverse climate change and we have the tools in our back pockets to do so," said Ms Corbett."The possibilities are enormous. But there's a lot of misinformed people in government and elsewhere who totally do not get agriculture, do not get the countryside, who have no trust in their countrymen."We're committed to the British landscape, not for a government party term but for 30, 50, 60 years time."Unfortunately, the government has total control over us because no one's paying the true price of food," she added.About £2.4bn per year in farming subsidies that was previously awarded by the EU has been guaranteed by the government for the term of this parliament.Ms Corbett's farm uses conservation grazing, which keeps natural habitats in good condition by preventing both overgrazing and undergrazing.She farms a rare breed of cow known as white park, of which there are less than 1,000 worldwide. By contrast, the current wild population of giant pandas is estimated at 1,864, according to WWF.But the farmer says she is effectively penalised for keeping a rare breed by rules in England that state cattle killed at 30 months or older must have the spine removed to minimise the risk to humans of "mad cow disease".White park cows are a slow-growing breed and take longer than 30 months to be ready for slaughter."It [the procedure] damages the carcass and means you'll get less cuts of meat, as muscle is removed along with the spine," she said."The procedure costs around £150 and devalues the meat, so it reduces the income by at least 10% overall."Following his speech outlining changes to net zero policies, the prime minister faced criticism for claiming he was "scrapping" proposals to increase air fares to discourage foreign holidays and tax meat consumption, neither of which have ever been government policies.Deputy President of the NFU Tom Bradshaw said that taxing specific food groups would be a "regressive approach".He said it was "more effective to consider provenance and method of production... regardless of where or how it has been produced".Ms Corbett said that despite a meat tax being ruled out, farmers were "never out of the woods. There's always a change of government".Any tax would have the "complete opposite effect of what I think... they're trying to achieve," she said.Farming Minister Mark Spencer said: "This government will always back British farmers who contribute billions to our economy, and are the custodians of our countryside."Our flexible new farming schemes - including our landmark Sustainable Farming Initiative which is now open - will deliver positive outcomes for domestic food production and the environment, alongside our continued investment in new technology and our work to boost every part of the food supply chain."I will continue to work closely with the sector to take on board feedback to ensure our schemes work in the best possible way so farmers can run profitable and sustainable businesses into the future."© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Algae map shows extent of Lough Neagh problems

Content:
New images and maps have been published which show the extent of environmental problems facing Lough Neagh.The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) released the information to try to help explain the deterioration in the lough.Toxic blue-green algae has been found in waterways at more than 60 locations across Northern Ireland since May.A map pinpointing the locations has been published which shows the algae has been on all sides of Lough Neagh.It has also been on a long stretch of the River Bann, ending on the north coast between Portstewart and Castlerock.Isolated outbreaks have been found in other areas including waters in east Antrim and north Down, plus a concentration in Lower Lough Erne in County Fermanagh.An image has been provided by the European Space Agency of Lough Neagh to help scientists and environmentalists trying to resolve the problems.Blue-green algae can be harmful to humans and highly toxic to animals.Daera has confirmed that in June the water temperature at Lough Neagh reached a record 17.4C.A spokesperson said: "The underpinning drivers of the increase in blue-green algae blooms include the excess nutrients from agricultural and waste water systems within the Lough Neagh catchment, combined with climate change and the associated weather patterns, with the very warm June, followed by the wet July and August."Lough Neagh is the largest freshwater lake in the UK and supplies half of Belfast's drinking water and 40% of Northern Ireland's overall. In spite of recent events, the authorities insist the drinking water is still safe.Although it is known as blue-green algae, it is technically a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria. It naturally inhabits freshwater, coastal and marine waters and, like plants, requires sunlight, nutrients and carbon dioxide to grow and reproduce.Daera says recent tests have shown the water in Lough Neagh is now three times clearer than in 2019.The spread of the invasive zebra mussel species is believed to have played a role in making the water clearer, allowing more sunlight to penetrate, stimulating more algal photosynthesis.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Will changes to net zero policies save us money?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66864122
Content:
Rishi Sunak's decision to extend some of the UK's net zero deadlines has proved - perhaps predictably - rather divisive.The prime minister said he was putting "the long-term interests of our country before the short-term political needs of the moment".Supporters say the planned green policies, including a 2030 ban on new petrol cars, would have hit people too hard financially, especially in such inflationary times.Critics, however, say taking longer to reach net zero will damage the UK's economic prospects, undermine business confidence and leave us behind in the global race for investment, they say.Even some of Mr Sunak's own MPs have warned that backtracking could cost jobs and push up energy bills in the future.So will the changes mean more money in people's pockets, as Mr Sunak's supporters claim? And what does a slower move to net zero mean for the UK economy?Mr Sunak says that "some of the things that were being proposed" - such as bans on new petrol and diesel cars and new gas boilers - "would have cost typical families upwards of £5,000, £10,000, £15,000".However the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), an independent think tank, has pointed out that no one was being forced to take up these measures immediately.The planned ban on the sale of gas boilers was not due to start until 2035, it says. The policy also only applied when a boiler broke or a person chose to switch.The think tank added that the PM cancelling new energy efficiency regulations for the private rental sector could cost British households almost £8bn in higher bills over the next decade - and more if gas prices spike again.ECIU director Peter Chalkley said that the changes to net zero policy would "add to the cost of living for those struggling, not make things easier".Meanwhile, Matthew Agarwala, a University of Cambridge environmental economist, described the overall changes as "reckless"."Renters face longer in lower quality homes, the public faces toxic air pollution for longer," he said. "And rather than taking control of transport costs with domestic renewable electricity, drivers are left exposed to the whims of international oil prices," he says.Pushing the ban on petrol and diesel engines from 2030 to 2035 is expected to have a "limited" effect on people's pockets, according to sources in the motor industry.The majority of people buy second-hand cars and the ban only relates to the sale of new vehicles.Car makers are split on the decision to push back the ban. Ford said watering down the policy would undermine the move to electric cars. Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover said the move was "pragmatic".Some in the car industry worry that the government is sending mixed messages - on one hand, telling manufacturers to make more electric cars with strict sales targets and fines for failure due in 2024, while on the other, appearing to tell consumers that they can put the brakes on switching.Analysts suggest that to meet sales quotas, car-makers may have to make electric vehicles cheaper. A new electric vehicle on average costs 39% more than its petrol or diesel equivalent.And there are concerns about Sunak's announcements outside the car industry, too.On gas boilers, industry group Energy UK said some of its members were pleased with the plan to boost grants for heat pumps and announcements on fast-tracking energy grid projects.However, its chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said members were mainly concerned about "uncertainty" and "change in tone" from government when it comes to them making investment decisions."Money moves," she said. "And there are now other places in the world going faster than we are."How will the switch to net zero impact the economy? Some of the costs of moving to a low-carbon economy are daunting, and jobs will undoubtedly go in old carbon-intense sectors.Stuart Adam, senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says some net zero policies could be a win-win for the economy and the environment - but warns there "there will be some [economic] pain" in the transition.As an example - a deal to keep the biggest steelworks in Britain open at Port Talbot will save 5,000 jobs, according to the government. The flip side is that up to 3,000 will still be lost.The government has already agreed to give £500m to Tata for the Port Talbot deal. The firm, which owns Jaguar Land Rover, will also get hundreds of millions in subsidies to build a new £4bn electric car battery factory in Somerset.Nissan has also secured £100m in public money towards a £1bn investment in expanding a Chinese-owned battery plant in Sunderland, and BMW has announced plans to invest hundreds of millions to transition its Mini factory in Oxford to electric car production.Chris Stark, the chief executive the UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC), said that such huge subsidies are "very tricky" in the short term - using the public purse to drive change can hit ordinary pockets.However the CCC, which oversees the government's progress on reducing greenhouse gases, estimates that short-term costs could be completely offset by long-term benefits.Mr Stark said that overall the transition may well deliver jobs and growth that wouldn't be there without it - an "invest-to-save" scenario.The independent consultancy Oxford Economics has concluded that forging ahead with transition could act as a catalyst for private-sector investment and boost the UK economy by 2050.Mr Agarwala, the environmental economist, said there was a risk that some people may be seeing things through "green-tinted glasses" that blur the impact of immediate costs.However, he argues that those costs won't necessarily be as high as some fear.Prices for green technology will continue to fall, he predicts, just as prices for solar and wind power have already plummeted."Either we face the upfront investment costs, which, like all other investments, yield benefits in the future," he said."Or we face the climate catastrophe costs, which yield no benefit, only disaster."© 2023 BBC.

Headline: More than 4,500 deaths in England during 2022 heat

There have been more than 50,000 heat-related deaths and more than 200,000 related to cold in England and Wales since 1988, new official figures show.The Office for National Statistics said very low and very high temperatures both increased the risk of death.And although cold is the bigger killer, the ONS said heat-related deaths appeared to have risen in recent years.Some 4,507 deaths were estimated to be linked to heat in England last year - when temperatures topped 40C.That was the highest number of estimated heat-related deaths over the last 35 years - but does not take into account population growth, and is a similar number to levels in the 1990s and early 2000s when the population was smaller.Last year, the UK saw record-breaking heat - with climate change playing a key role in pushing temperatures so high.The extreme heat caused disruption across the country, and data has already suggested about 3,000 more over-65s died than usual in England and Wales last summer.According to the ONS, once temperatures hit 25C, the number of temperature-related deaths go up by about 50%, compared to the optimal temperature for people. Below -5C, the number of temperature-related deaths shoot up by about 75%.However such temperatures above 25C or below -5C were only experienced on relatively few days over the study period, and therefore contributed relatively few deaths, the ONS points out.It comes as researchers from Oxford University recently published a report saying many UK buildings need to be renovated to protect people from extreme heat - including in large cities which can be several degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside.The ONS said the highest risk of death was in London on days when temperatures top 29C - when the mortality risk triples, compared to when temperatures are between 9C and 22C.And all regions of England and Wales showed an increased risk of death when temperatures rose above 22C.The ONS compiled its figures based on information from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis and created a new method to understand how temperature affects risk of death.Their analysis also showed a sharp rise in deaths during the winter of 2010/11 when the UK saw unusually cold temperatures.Holly Holder, from the charity the Centre for Ageing Better, said the new statistics showed "it would be a grave mistake to slow down or roll back net-zero policies", the PA news agency reported."Climate change isn't just something that is happening in the Antarctic or in very hot countries, it is impacting lives, and taking lives, here in the UK," she said."Our housing is the oldest, and among the poorest quality in Western Europe and is not fit for purpose to face the challenges of more extreme temperatures and weather."This week Rishi Sunak announced plans to weaken some of the government's green commitments, such as delaying a ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars.But Mr Sunak insisted the UK was still on track to hit its targets - and it was not necessary to make the changes earlier than needed.Experts have previously said that the record-breaking heat seen in the UK last year will be considered cool by the end of this century. They say the record heat for the UK was made much more likely by climate change.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

Headline: Airport's extended runway completed

An airport has marked the official completion of an extended runway.Southampton Airport had the 164m (538ft) extension added between its existing runway and its northern boundary fence.It said the longer runway was "absolutely critical" to its viability as a regional airport and to handle a wider variety of aircraft.The airport faced local opposition concerned about the noise and disturbance caused by larger planes.The scheme was approved in April 2021, but campaigners claimed permission was "unlawfully granted".However, last year the Court of Appeal upheld Eastleigh Borough Council's decision to approve the plans.The airport has argued that the expansion will protect jobs and generate an extra £240m for the local economy by 2037.The extension was controversial. It took Eastleigh councillors 16 hours of heated debate to approve it - a difficult choice for a council that had declared a climate emergency.The airport can now handle fully-laden holiday flights to Mediterranean destinations, perhaps as far away as the Greek islands or north Africa, using the sort of aircraft flown by EasyJet or Ryanair.As yet, no airline has signed up for these longer sunshine flights.Passenger numbers in 2022 were 640,000, still below one third of pre-Covid numbers.The airport said its future rested on the extended tarmac, because of a reduction in business travel since the pandemic.It also argued that refusing a longer runway would not reduce total carbon emissions. It would merely shift passengers and jobs to rival airports.Deciding whether or not to allow it was a huge local issue.One on level, a conflict between local jobs and holiday choices against increased noise pollution for an additional 46,000 people.On another, it was about drawing a line in shifting sands.Economic benefits now weighed against long-term decarbonisation, and a growing acceptance that addressing climate change also means travelling less.As yesterday's government announcement shows, it's a subject where public opinion remains fluid.The airport previously said its existing runway was "one of the shortest in the UK" and inhibited the use of larger planes, such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737.Campaigners objected on the grounds of climate change and noise, after planning documents revealed that the number of people affected by noise would go from 11,450 in 2020, to 46,050 in 2033 if the expansion went ahead.The airport has pledged to try to mitigate the concerns raised.Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Headline: Solar panel rebel backs down to avoid prison

Content:
A woman who put solar panels on her Grade II listed home without permission is to remove them after being warned she could go to prison.Environmental activist Mary Smail, who already has a criminal record for taking part in climate action, said she did not want to risk being jailed.She has been involved in a long-running and costly legal battle with Derbyshire Dales District Council.The council said the 16 solar panels caused "harm" to "heritage assets".Ms Smail, 64, from Church Street in Ashbourne, applied to the council for planning permission to install the solar panels but said she was advised there was no chance of it being granted due to the historic nature of the area.She then installed them anyway while the council was considering her application and applied retrospectively for permission, which was refused.The council finally got a court injunction to force her to take the panels down by June.When she did not, it wrote to her warning her she could be jailed for two years if she had not taken steps to remove them by a new deadline of 19 September.Ms Smail said she did not attend the injunction hearing because she was at a different court supporting her partner, who was one of the protesters who climbed on a gantry over the M25.Ms Smail, who said she had previously been fined for obstructing the highway during Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion protests, said: "This isn't a hill worth dying on because I think I've made my point."Nobody is going to want to go to prison for two years over solar panels."She said she had contacted the installers and is in the process of arranging a date to get them taken down.In a statement, Derbyshire Dales District Council said: "Unfortunately, the solar panels installed on the roof introduce an alien shape, grouping, texture and reflective quality in place of the existing matt finish, texture and appearance of the clay tiled roof."Our planning committee agreed that the modest general public benefit of the installation was clearly outweighed by the harm caused to the heritage assets in this case."As well as being Grade II listed, Ms Smail's home is in a conservation area.Adding solar panels to a property normally falls within the scope of "permitted development", so planning permission is not required.However, putting solar panels on listed buildings and those within conservation areas usually does require planning permission.In addition to planning permission, Listed Building Consent is required for changes to a listed building in any manner which would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest.Historic England advises people to check the website of their local council, as policies vary between councils.The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, for example, introduced a Local Listed Buildings Consent Order so that residents of Grade II and most Grade II* listed buildings no longer need to apply for individual consent to install solar panels.Ms Smail said she had spent £10,000 on legal fees and had also been asked to pay £9,700 to cover the council's legal costs.Ms Smail previously told the BBC she had broken the rules "in order to open the dialogue"."If bad laws are not challenged then they never get changed and we can see that through things like the suffragettes and civil rights in America," she said."I knew that I was going to get into a lot of trouble for it but I thought it was worth it."Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Headline: Seven bins and Sunak's other net zero claims
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66878893
Content:
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been responding to questions after making a speech about his net zero plans on Wednesday.We've been looking at some of his claims.Mr Sunak has defended his suggestion that the government has ruled out households needing seven rubbish and recycling bins.The government had previously said it wanted to standardise waste collection in England, which would mean recyclables and rubbish would have to be separated (potentially into different bins) although the plan was subsequently delayed.Theoretically, the bins would have been for glass, paper and cardboard, metal, plastic, garden waste, food waste and general rubbish.In a statement at the time, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it wanted to make recycling "easier" and more consistent across councils, but did not say that would necessarily mean more bins.Speaking on Wednesday night, former Environment Secretary George Eustice said "it wasn't government policy, no, that's right", when asked on Channel 4 News about the seven bins, but added the government was "assailed by representations of this sort".The prime minister said: "We've decarbonised faster than any other economy in the G7."On the measure generally used for that he's right - UK emissions almost halved between 1990 and the end of 2022, which is indeed more than the other six advanced economies in the G7.But that figure only covers what are known as territorial emissions, so it doesn't include emissions from making products that the UK imports.A lot of the UK's cuts in emissions were as a result of the closure of some heavy industry and the move away from coal. Since the international climate agreement was signed in Paris at the end of 2015, Germany has been reducing its emissions faster than the UK.The plan was already to phase out the installation of new natural gas boilers from 2035, which is still the policy.The change to government policy on installing new boilers will not affect most households.But there are some changes. The first is that there will be exemptions to that 2035 phase out for about 20% of properties where it would be most difficult to move to lower-emission alternatives such as heat pumps.Also, in 2026 the government was proposing to start phasing out the installation of boilers powered by oil and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) for properties that could not get gas. The ban has now been moved to 2035.The government release announcing the change said: "Many of these homes are not suitable for heat pumps"But the government-funded Electrification of Heat project said: "There is no property type or architectural era that is unsuitable for a heat pump".Rishi Sunak told Today on BBC Radio 4 that the government had "absolute belief" that it would still hit its legally-binding targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.But even before this week's policy shifts were announced, there were warnings that the UK's future targets were at risk.In June, the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) - which was appointed by the government to monitor progress towards net zero - called progress "worryingly slow" and called for more urgent action.A few of the measures announced by Mr Sunak may help - for example the increase in grants to upgrade from gas boilers to heat pumps from £5,000 to £7,500.But most amount to a pushback in policies - like the delay to the new petrol car ban or scrapping some energy efficiency measures.The CCC's chief executive told Today that the prime minister was guilty of "wishful thinking" if he thought net zero goals could be achieved with this "softer package" of green policies.That's certainly the view of the scientists the BBC has spoken to.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Sunak: My net zero plan is not wishful thinking

Content:
Rishi Sunak has insisted the UK will meet its net zero targets despite being accused of "wishful thinking" by the government's own climate adviser.In an interview with the BBC, the PM said he was not slowing down efforts to combat climate change, after a major overhaul of some green policies.The move has provoked a backlash, with the Climate Change Committee (CCC) saying the UK had "moved backwards".But Mr Sunak said he was "confident" the UK would hit net zero by 2050.In a bid to seize the political agenda, the prime minister announced exemptions and delays to several key green policies, alongside a 50% increase in cash incentives to replace gas boilers.Key among the changes in his speech was a five-year delay in the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.Lagging far behind Labour in the polls, the Conservatives under Mr Sunak are seeking to create dividing lines with opposition parties ahead of a general election, expected next year.For weeks, Mr Sunak has been signalling a shift in approach to net zero, which means achieving a balance between the carbon emitted into and removed from the atmosphere.He has sought to frame his changes to green policies as "pragmatic" and has highlighted the costs of low-carbon technology, such as electric cars.But earlier this year, the Climate Change Committee - the government's independent advisers on cutting carbon emissions - warned that the UK's attempts to achieve its net zero commitments were already "worryingly slow".The chief executive of the committee, Chris Stark, said the changes announced by Mr Sunak on Wednesday would make it harder for the government to hit legally binding climate goals."The wishful thinking here is that we have not got a policy package to hit the legal targets this country has set in law," Mr Stark told the BBC.Although he agreed that "you can't just wish and will your way to net zero", Mr Sunak said "people have asserted these targets without having an honest conversation with the country about what's required to deliver them".Since his speech, Mr Sunak has faced criticism for claiming he was "scrapping" proposals to increase air fares to discourage foreign holidays and tax meat consumption, neither of which have ever been government policies.In the interview, the BBC's Nick Robinson asked Mr Sunak if he was being "honest" about scrapping policies that "don't exist".Taking aim at the CCC, Mr Sunak accused the committee of "euphemistically" proposing compulsory car-pooling, as well as a tax on meat.When asked where this proposal had come from, the prime minister said the CCC had called for ministers to "implement measures" for "accelerated change in diets".In its 2023 report assessing the government's net zero plans, the committee proposed "low-cost, low-regret" action to reduce meat consumption - not a tax.The full recommendation from the report, published in June, is: "Take low-cost, low-regret actions to encourage a 20% shift away from all meat by 2030, rising to 35% by 2050, and a 20% shift from dairy products by 2030, demonstrating leadership in the public sector whilst improving health."Mr Sunak was asked whether, by going against the recommendations of the committee, he was copying former Prime Minister Liz Truss by ignoring advice on her economic policies.In response, Mr Sunak said: "I'm happy to get opinions and advice from everybody and everyone's entitled to their view".And on being pressed on the prospect of legal challenges over his plans, he said he had "absolute confidence and belief" the UK will hit its targets.This video can not be playedWatch: Rishi Sunak's shift on green policies - what he said then and nowThe prime minister said Wednesday's speech was the first in a series which would "change the direction of our country", adding: "I know I'll get criticism and flak but I'm not going to be deterred."He denied he was changing green policies for short-term political gain, as his party struggles to catch up with Labour in the polls.Labour said the watering down of green pledges would cost the public more in the long term and accused Mr Sunak "selling out" the opportunity for a jobs boom.Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow energy security secretary, said he relished the opportunity to go "toe-to-toe" with the Conservatives on net zero during the election campaign.In a move to widen the policy gap between the two main parties, Labour said it remained committed to the phase out of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.This year has been one of record-breaking temperatures and extreme weather events. Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries - including the UK - agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100.To achieve this, scientists say net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.But the United Nations wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets to avert what it has called "the growing climate disaster".Although the UK is only responsibly for 1% of global emissions, it has been one of the most ambitious countries in cutting its carbon footprint.Following Mr Sunak's announcement, climate activists and some Conservative MPs have accused the prime minister of abandoning the UK's climate leadership.Speaking to the BBC from the UN's Climate Action Summit, which Mr Sunak did not attend, former Conservative minster Sir Alok Sharma said the response from international colleagues at the event had been one of "consternation"."My concern is whether people now look to us and say, 'Well, if the UK is starting to row back on some of these policies, maybe we should do the same'," said Sir Alok, who chaired the COP26 climate summit.© 2023 BBC.

The government is increasing the financial support available to help households in England and Wales replace their gas boilers with heat pumps.The Boiler Upgrade Grant is rising from £5,000 to £7,500.The sale of new gas boilers will still be banned from 2035 but poorer households will now be exempt.The boiler upgrade scheme was launched in April 2022 to help reduce the cost of more environmentally-friendly heating systems.It is part of the government's commitment to reach "net zero" - the point at which the UK no longer adds to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -  by 2050.Grants are available to existing homes and non-domestic buildings in England and Wales, and can be used for:Even at the increased level, the grant will not necessarily cover the full cost of installation.The property must have an eligible Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) issued in the last 10 years, with no outstanding recommendations to install loft or cavity wall insulation.If that has been recommended, you'll need to insulate your home first, or do it as part of the application process.The scheme is not available if you live in social housing or a new-build property. Private rented accommodation is also eligible but the landlord has to apply.Then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak also announced in the 2022 Spring Statement that there would be no VAT on heat pumps for five years in England, Scotland and Wales.Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate schemes to help make homes more efficient.In March 2023, the government extended the scheme until 2028, after the House of Lords Net Zero Committee warned take-up was so low the national target for green heating was "very unlikely to be met".In September, as part of a series of changes to the government's approach to net zero, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the 2035 ban would remain and the grant increase.He also said there would be a "new exemption" to help households who would particularly struggle to switch. The government suggests this could apply to about a fifth of homes.It is also delaying the ban on installing oil and liquid-petroleum-gas (LPG) boilers and new coal heating for "off-gas-grid" homes, to 2035.This had been due to be phased in from 2026 but the government wants to give these households more time to adapt.Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the average life of a boiler was about 15 years - so even if people had a gas boiler at the time of the ban, 2035, the 2050 target could still be met.Baroness Parminter, who chairs the Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee, heavily criticised ministers for the lack of progress made and low levels of awareness of the "seriously failing" scheme.The government's own research from Autumn 2022 showed 80% of people in the UK did not know what a heat pump was, let alone had heard of the grant.The scheme initially had a budget of £150m each year for three years and aimed to issue 30,000 vouchers annually. But in the first eight months of operation, only 9,888 grants were awarded.The committee also found there was a lack of training for engineers leading to a shortage of heat pump installers, and said more needed to be done to bring down the cost of heat pumps.At the time, the government said it had launched a marketing campaign to boost public awareness "and will consider further options to ensure our targets are met".A heat pump is an electrically-powered device which absorbs heat from the air, ground or water around a building.For example, air-source pumps suck in outdoor air and pass it over tubes containing refrigerant fluids to produce heat.This video can not be playedHeat pumps explained in 60 secondsA box of about 1m x 1m x 0.4m needs to stand outside - close to, or attached to the property - to draw in air.It should be at least 1m from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it won't be much louder than a fridge.You will also need space inside for a heat pump unit and hot water cylinder. The unit will be about the size of a gas boiler - while the cylinder depends on the size of the home.A ground source heat pump needs much more space outside - either a bore hole as deep as 100m, or a horizontal system dug into the ground over a large area.Heat pumps are normally three times more efficient than gas boilers, but they use electricity to run, and electricity prices can be more expensive than gas, so it depends on fossil-fuel energy costs.The government has previously said it will look at measures to ensure heat pumps are no more expensive to run than a gas boiler in the long run.© 2023 BBC.

This video can not be playedWatch: UK easing transition to electric vehicles - SunakRishi Sunak has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050.The prime minister announced exemptions and delays to several key green policies, alongside a 50% increase in cash incentives to replace gas boilers.The government could not impose "unacceptable costs" linked to reducing emissions on British families, he said.It's prompted fierce criticism from the opposition and some industry bosses.Mr Sunak also faced attacks from his own party, but many Conservative MPs came out in favour of the new direction, alongside some in the car industry.The changes come as Mr Sunak seeks to create dividing lines with opposition parties ahead of a general election, expected next year.Framing the changes as "pragmatic and proportionate", the prime minister has unpicked several of Boris Johnson's key policies, many of them launched when Mr Sunak was serving as chancellor.In a speech from Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said moving too fast on green policies "risks losing the consent of the British people".Among the key changes announced were:Mr Sunak ran the changes past a hastily organised cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, after proposals were revealed by the BBC.Responding to the statement, Labour unequivocally committed itself to keeping the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.Shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said without the ban the UK would miss its target to hit net zero - this is the point at which a country is no longer adding to the overall amount of harmful greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Mr Reed said the prime minster had "sold out the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st Century" for Britain "to lead the world in transition to well-paid secured new jobs of the green economy".Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf told the BBC the move was "utterly unforgiveable" and "very firmly takes the UK out of the global consensus".Speaking from a UN summit on climate action, which Mr Sunak had declined to attend, Mr Yousaf said: "The same day the whole world is gathered to talk about what more we can do, we have a UK prime minister rolling back on [the UK's] commitments."The BBC's Chris Mason says Mr Sunak and his advisers will hope that beyond the criticism, many voters might quietly conclude he is onto something and being reasonable.Mr Sunak's proposals are dividing his party, Parliament, and many in the country, but the PM will be looking at Labour's lead in the opinion polls and concluding he has no choice but to gamble.And the political choices outlined in his speech preview more announcements later this autumn, as Mr Sunak promised he would set out "a series of long term decisions".This video can not be playedWatch: Rishi Sunak's shift on green policies - what he said then and nowBillions of pounds has already been invested across multiple industries, including car makers and energy firms, in preparation of the previous deadlines.Korean carmaker Kia, which has plans to launch nine new electric vehicles over the next few years, said the announcement was disappointing as it "alters complex supply chain negotiations and product planning, whilst potentially contributing to consumer and industry confusion".The chief executive of energy company E.On, Chris Norbury, said it was a "misstep on many levels", adding that it was a "false argument" to suggest green policies can only come at a cost."We risk condemning people to many more years of living in cold and draughty homes that are expensive to heat, in cities clogged with dirty air from fossil fuels, missing out on the economic regeneration this ambition brings," Mr Norbury said.Jaguar Land Rover, which announced hundreds of new jobs in the West Midlands a few days ago, welcomed the change, calling it "pragmatic" and adding that it brings the UK in line with other nations."Pragmatic" was also how Toyota described the changes.Elsewhere, Mr Sunak also suggested he would be "scrapping" a range of proposals which had been "thrown up" by the debate, including hiking up air fares to discourage foreign holidays and taxes on meat consumption. Neither of these had been government policy.Mr Sunak argued that without transparency and "honest debate" on the impact of green policies there would be a "backlash" against net zero.But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Sunak of being "selfish" and said the changes "epitomise his weakness"."The prime minister's legacy will be the hobbling of our country's future economy as he ran scared from the right wing of his own party," he said.The UK was now "at the back of the queue as the rest of the world races to embrace the industries of tomorrow", Sir Ed added.Speaking to the BBC from the UN's Climate Action Summit, Sir Alok Sharma, a former Conservative minister who chaired the COP26 climate summit, said the response from international colleagues at the event had been one of "consternation"."My concern is whether people now look to us and say, 'Well, if the UK is starting to row back on some of these policies, maybe we should do the same'," he said.Also speaking from the summit, former US vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore said the announcement marked a "turn back in the wrong direction"."At times in the past, the UK has been one of the impressive leaders on climate. And so for those who have come to expect that from the UK, it's a particular disappointment," he told the BBC.Chris Stark, chief executive of the UK's independent Climate Change Committee, said the changes would make it harder for the government to meet legally binding climate goals.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Stark added that the committee had already advised the government in June that it "didn't look like we were on track" to meet 2030 emissions targets, before these changes were announced.However, the shift in policy has gained support from some within Mr Sunak's party.Former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg backed the changes, telling the BBC: "The problem with net zero and having regulations coming in so quickly was that it was a scheme of the elite on the backs of the least well off."Mr Sunak is instead "going with the grain of the nation and moving for 'intelligent net zero' by 2050 but not putting in costly bans in the next few years."Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.© 2023 BBC.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pushed back a plan to ban selling new petrol and diesel cars.The original plan was that people wouldn't be allowed to buy new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. This has now been pushed back to 2035.This was all a part of a big announcement about net zero, and Rishi Sunak has made some other changes to the UK's climate change plan as well.Unsure about what all the words mean? You can find a climate change term-buster further down the page.When we burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and gas, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.You can become net zero by taking out as many greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere that you put in.This can be done by reducing how much carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Rishi Sunak's original plan was to ban people from buying petrol and diesel cars from 2030. This is because cars powered by petrol and diesel emit carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas.This ban is now going to be pushed back until 2035. He said that by 2030, lots of people will be using electric cars anyway as technology gets better.He has also said people will have more time to change over to using heat pumps to keep their homes warm. Heat pumps are an extremely energy efficient way to create heat, but Rishi Sunak says they can be quite expensive to install.Also, the Prime Minister says that there won't be a ban on drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea.Oil and gas are fossil fuels, and when burned they release greenhouse gasses, which contribute to global warming.Greenhouse Gasses - Gasses that trap heat in the atmosphereAtmosphere - The layer of gasses around earthCarbon dioxide (CO2) - A type of greenhouse gas, released by burning coal, oil, or gasGlobal warming - Caused by greenhouse not allowing heat to escape.Climate Change - The result of global warming. As the earth heats up we are more exposed to extreme weather conditions such as storms and heatwavesThis latest announcement is a change to what Rishi Sunak has said about the UK's green plans in the past.He has said that the UK will reach net zero by 2050, and that the UK has "overdelivered" on its climate change policies so far.Could this new discovery help stop palm oil deforestation?Fighting climate misinformation on TikTokWhy climate change could drive UK moths 'to extinction'Earlier this year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had announced a plan for the UK to reach net zero.

Headline: 'Power up heat-pump scheme' say manufacturers

Across the UK, our homes have about 22 million boilers that burn fossil fuels. The government wants us to help the environment by switching to electricity for heating and hot water, and has just increased incentives to householders in England and Wales.The scheme launched in May 2022, but has so far helped just 21,000 homes to convert. Firms behind new heating technologies say the government should go further, and faster.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced incentives of at least £5,000 to install heat pumps or biomass boilers would be increased to at least £7,500.When Damian Lofthouse wanted to change his oil-fired boiler for something greener, he considered an air source heat pump, but decided against it, despite the government incentive.Mr Lofthouse, from Norwich, hoped to cut his family's carbon footprint, and using electricity for heating and hot water was the next step.Heating our homes contributes around 14% of the UK's carbon emissions and the Westminster government is pushing heat pumps to replace gas and oil boilers.As well as being VAT-free, under the £450m Boiler Upgrade Scheme, air source heat pumps and biomass boilers attracted a £5,000 grant in England and Wales, with £6,000 available for ground source heat pumps.The prime minister announced at a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that grants were being increased by 50%.Mr Lofthouse, 40, asked heat pump installers to conduct surveys and draw up quotes, but the results were not positive.They told him "every radiator would need to be replaced" and that he might need planning permission."It got to a point where it just wasn't really sustainable for us in terms of the cost and disruption," Mr Lofthouse said.He is not alone. While heat pumps can be installed in virtually any property, a briefing by the UK Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology in July said "most UK housing will need radiator upgrades to achieve good performance".Katharine Kemp, from Norfolk-based Leaping Hare Renewables, said that when installing a heat pump, "the whole house can have a great deal of disruption."That could be two weeks or sometimes longer, she added.Between May 2022 and July 2023, the Boiler Upgrade Scheme received grant applications for 21,212 air source and ground source heat pumps, an average of around 1,415 a month. It also helped pay for a much smaller number of biomass boilers.In February, the House of Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee said the scheme was "seriously failing to deliver" with a "disappointingly low take-up".In response, the government said the take-up of heat pumps was higher under the current scheme than the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive, which it replaced.Instead of a heat pump, Mr Lofthouse bought a "zero-emission boiler" from Tepeo.The smart storage heater charges itself up when electricity is cheaper and greener, and then discharges into a home's existing radiators or hot water tank.It does not qualify for any subsidies or VAT exemptions.Tepeo's CEO and founder Johan Du Plessis said the government's policy needed to "get with the times".Heat pumps were a "very important part of the solution", he said, but it was "very one-dimensional" to try to apply a single technology to all homes."Every single home in this country is different and we need to have a range of different options for people to decarbonise and electrify their heating, otherwise it's going to put people off," he said."For millions of homes out there for whom heat pumps don't work for a variety of reasons, those people are being excluded from the current policies that the government is employing."A letter organised by Thermal Storage UK, an industry lobby group, and signed by organisations including the Energy Saving Trust and Citizens Advice, asked the Treasury to update a list of VAT-exempt energy-efficient products that had not been added to since 2006.Richard Nugee, chair of manufacturer Remit Zero, whose emission-free boiler replacement called Cylo does not qualify for financial incentives, said: "What government should do is provide that subsidy to all decarbonising heat sources... so that it is a level playing field."That way, he added, home-owners, housing associations and others "can make their own choice as to which is the best product".Great Yarmouth-based CeraPhi Energy believes it has another potential solution: deep geothermal.It involves drilling up to 5km (3.1 miles) into the ground and capturing the higher temperatures beneath the earth's surface.Gary Williams, CeraPhi co-founder, said it could be used to heat water in shared systems at large developments such as universities, hospitals and new housing estates.The company is testing its technology in a disused fracking well in Yorkshire and said places like Hunstanton – a geothermal hotspot on the north Norfolk coast – could be ideal."We started this three years ago and at that time the government really wasn't looking at deep geothermal - it was being dismissed," Mr Williams said.But the technology - like offshore wind power 25 years ago - needed government backing to mature, he added."Government is starting to wake up – but they're are a long, long way behind where they need to be in supporting this industry," he said.A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: "The Boiler Upgrade Scheme has paid out £81m-worth of vouchers to date and, as a result, families can now install a heat pump for an increasingly similar price to a gas boiler."Heat pumps are a proven option of decarbonising heat, and we remain fully committed on meeting our aim of 600,000 installations a year by 2028."The Treasury said it did not comment on tax policy outside of the Budget or the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, but taxes were always under review.Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook and Instagram.

Headline: PM gambles as he walks towards blizzard of criticism

Content:
Behind his mild-mannered demeanour, Rishi Sunak's announcement was an excoriating demolition of the Conservative governments that came before his, some of which he was a member of.Boris Johnson didn't get a name check as the prime minister outlined a major shift in green policies, but boy his ideas and instincts were shredded; painted as shallow and not thought through.In the news conference room in No 9 Downing Street, Mr Sunak stood in front of a new slogan with - and I know this is niche - a new font."Long term decisions for a brighter future," it read - expect to see that rather prominently around the place at the Conservative party conference in Manchester in ten days' time.Mr Sunak framed this announcement as a blunt, direct and pragmatic clearing up job that also illustrated his political creed - willing to embrace controversy to deliver what he believes is a hard-headed necessity.He sought to walk towards the blizzard of criticism - an unlikely alliance taking in Ford and the National Trust among many others - rather than cower from it.No 10 certainly hadn't planned for their ideas to get leaked, as they were to the BBC, and were mighty narked that they had.But the rows about the substance of what they were saying were expected, and embraced.This is the beginning of a wider political strategy.Further speeches will follow this autumn on wider themes; expect more leaning in from the prime minister towards a more aggressive approach.On these green themes, he and his advisers hope, beyond those with megaphones and PR departments condemning him today, many might quietly conclude he is on to something and being reasonable.And when one of the big political parties makes a bit of a splash with a policy launch or change of direction, it is always instructive to closely observe how their opponents react.Labour's response to this - beyond the predictable criticism of the Conservatives - was cautious. There wasn't an instant commitment to reversing all of the Conservative changes.The party's position on the time to ban new petrol and diesel cars publicly shifted. There was an initial hesitancy about what they would do, before later committing to restoring the ban from 2030, rather than 2035.In other words, Labour were forced to rapidly work out how to respond, and the space for a political argument is opening up; a wedge between them.Now, the big question hovers. Will Mr Sunak's pitch be popular?Folk in government are already pointing to a poll they claim suggests it is. Others point to polling which hints at the opposite.In short, for Mr Sunak, this is a gamble.Having assiduously avoided stoking public rows within the Conservative Party for the last year, he has now chosen to do just that.Those rows extend to parliament, and to the country.But a prime minister miles behind their opponents, with an election on the horizon, has no choice but to gamble.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Migratory birds 'in freefall' over climate change

British bird lovers will see a very different pattern of species as the climate warms, according to scientists.They say climate change is bad news for birds, but locally we will see "winners and losers".Migrants seldom seen on British shores, such as black-winged stilts and bee-eaters, are delighting bird watchers.But populations of cuckoos are "in freefall" as UK wildlife struggles to cope with multiple pressures.In nature-depleted Britain, almost half of all bird species are in decline due to a host of pressures - from the loss of meadows, hedgerows and other natural land to climate change and the use of pesticides.The number of wild birds in Britain has fallen by 73 million since 1970, according to the British Trust for Ornithology, which studies birds in the British Isles.Head of ringing, Dr Dave Leech, said climate change was a growing pressure, particularly for migratory birds dealing with extreme weather on several continents.He told BBC News: "Climate change is one of the biggest pressures that all species are facing, but particularly migratory species, because they have to worry about the climate conditions not only where they're breeding, but also where they're wintering and the areas that they're travelling through to get here, which can be thousands of kilometres."Some birds such as reed warblers are taking advantage of longer, hotter summers by producing more young. Others, such as the Cetti's warbler, which colonised the UK some decades ago, are expanding their range north.Yet many species, including the cuckoo and the willow warbler, are declining in southern Britain as the climate warms.Scientists think some birds are having difficulty adjusting their internal clocks to cope with changes in the seasons.Cuckoos spend their summer in the UK, arriving in April when they can be heard making their distinctive call. They then leave in late June to over-winter in Africa.Dr Dave Leech said the birds are struggling to make it back over the Sahara because climate change means there's less food for them to fuel up with before they make the crossing, and that their numbers were in "free fall"."How terrible would it be if future generations never heard a cuckoo, something that was so commonplace in British wildlife before now?" he said.Many other migratory birds leave British shores and travel south around now, with others arriving from northern countries.For decades, thousands of skilled bird ringers and other volunteers have been collecting data on changes in British bird populations, shedding light on their decline.Peter has been ringing birds for many years in Gloucestershire. There "will be winners as a result of climate change and losers", he said."Future generations might not hear a nightingale or see a cuckoo but there will be other things they see."A bee-eater might become a common species for example.  And by collecting all this ringing data we can monitor what is going on and mitigate for the human- led climate change that is the major driver behind most of these changes."Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: What does net zero mean?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58874518
Content:
PM Rishi Sunak has announced plans to weaken some of the government's green commitments.This includes delaying a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, as well as scrapping policies that would force landlords to upgrade efficiency in their homes.Even before these latest changes, the UK was being criticised for falling behind in its efforts to reach "net zero" by 2050, a key international target intended to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill.These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries - including the UK - agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100.To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.However, the UN wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called "the growing climate disaster".Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as "offsetting".Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.On 20 September, Rishi Sunak announced major changes to the UK's approach to the net zero target, including:Mr Sunak denied he was "watering down" the government's net zero commitments, and insisted the UK was on course to reach its target by 2050, saying that a "more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach" was needed.Labour said the prime minister had "sold out the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century" for Britain "to lead the world in transition to well-paid secured new jobs of the green economy".There was also a mixed reaction from within his own party, as well as among business leaders, with some calling it a "mis-step" while others described the announcement as pragmatic.The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards achieving net zero by 2050.While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.This could include:Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for "carbon neutrality" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies.The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself.But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels.But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.© 2023 BBC.

Headline: Could Sunak's green review threaten UK net zero?
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66867679
Content:
The prime minister has said he wants to be honest about the "costs and trade-offs" of tackling climate change.In a statement on Tuesday, Rishi Sunak said he was proud that "Britain is leading the world on climate change", and will stick by the agreements the UK has made internationally.But he then overhauled measures designed to meet these targets.So, is the UK really a world leader on emissions cuts, and how will the changes the PM announced  affect its efforts?Mr Sunak said the government was still "completely committed" to the 2050 net zero target which his predecessor, Theresa May, made law back in 2019.Net zero means a country does not add any additional greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."This country is proud to be a world leader in reaching net zero by 2050. But we simply won't achieve it unless we change. We'll now have a more pragmatic, proportionate, and realistic approach that eases the burdens on families," he said.It is true the UK has been successful in cutting emissions compared to other countries.Since 1990, emissions within the UK have fallen by 48.7% up to the end of 2022 - excluding international aviation and shipping - according to government data.These cuts are greater than other countries in the G7 (Group of Seven), an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called "advanced" economies - although Germany has reduced its emissions at a faster rate compared with the UK since 2015.But the cuts the UK has made so far are - arguably - the easiest ones.One of the main ways they have been achieved is by switching away from fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to generate electricity.Emissions from electricity generation have fallen by around three-quarters since 1990, while the proportion of electricity generated by renewables - like wind and solar - has soared.The government has bold plans to continue this "decarbonisation" process.But achieving net zero means cutting emissions across all sectors of the economy.That is why there are targets for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles and switching from gas boilers to heat pumps or other low-carbon alternatives to heat our homes.And, despite the UK's achievements on climate so far, there have been a number of warnings that progress is beginning to falter. These came even before today's announcement.Earlier this year, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) - the government's independent advisers on cutting carbon emissions - warned that the UK's efforts to meet its net zero commitments were already "worryingly slow".It also said it was "markedly less confident" than a year earlier that it would meet its 2030 and 2035 emissions reduction targets.Similar warnings on electricity have come from the National Audit Office and a cross-party group of MPs.But contrary to these findings, Mr Sunak claimed in his announcement that the UK was "on track" to meet its commitments.He also announced a substantial increase in the subsidies available to people who want to install heat pumps to heat their home, with the grant increased by 50% to £7,500.The CCC says it was not consulted ahead of the announcement, and needed to do the full calculations before determining the carbon cost.But the changes certainly seem to make the current targets much harder to achieve - as any extra carbon costs would have to be balanced by extra savings in other areas. And how much carbon the UK can use in coming years has already been set down in carbon budgets."Today's announcement is likely to take the UK further away from being able to meet its legal commitments," said Piers Forster, the CCC's chair."This, coupled with the recent unsuccessful offshore wind auction, gives us concern," and "more action is needed," he added."What's depressing about all the changes [the PM] has told us about is they all go in the same direction," Prof Miles Allen of the University of Oxford told the BBC."If we do everything slower, we're just going to make it more difficult to reach that target," he said.One of the most eye-catching changes is delaying the 2030 ban on sales of new, fully petrol and diesel cars, announced by Mr Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson.Despite what's often assumed, electric car sales are actually surging. In 2022, nearly 17% of new car sales were battery electric - ahead of the CCC's schedule and up from less than 2% in 2019.Some in the car industry have warned that delaying the ban on new petrol and diesel cars could hit investment and therefore electric vehicle sales.Achieving the 2030 phase-out of new fully petrol and diesel car and van sales is "vital to meeting the UK's decarbonisation pathway", the CCC warned in June.But Mr Sunak says it should be the consumer who decides whether or not to buy an electric car and not "government forcing you to do it". He also says the new plan is in line with countries including Germany, France, Spain and Canada.Mr Sunak says his review of the government's green pledges is all about putting the "long-term interests of our country before the short-term political needs of the moment."He said "some of the things that were being proposed would have cost typical families upwards of five, ten, fifteen thousand pounds".But the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) - an independent climate change think tank - points out that nobody is being forced to take up these measures right now.For example, the planned ban on the sale of new gas boilers was due to start in 2035 for all households. It is only relevant when your boiler breaks or you choose to switch.It is a similar story with cars.  Four out of five of us buy second-hand cars - for which there is no phase-out date - and older cars can continue to be driven after 2030.The 20% of people who can afford to buy a new car already had six years until they would have had to choose between fully electric vehicles and hybrids - which can be filled up with petrol. Now they have 11 years.The changes to net zero policy "will add to the cost of living for those struggling, not make things easier", argues Peter Chalkley, a director of the ECIU.And an analysis by the ECIU suggests the PM's announcements could cost British households almost £8bn in higher bills over the next decade - and more if gas prices spike again - due to cancelling new energy efficiency regulations for the private rental sector.The CCC has estimated that meeting the legally binding 2050 goal will require an extra £50bn of investment every year by 2030.It said that once the savings from reduced use of fossil fuels are factored in, the overall resource cost of the transition to net zero is less than 1% of GDP over the next 30 years. By 2044 it should become cost-saving, the CCC said, as newer cleaner technologies are more efficient than those they are replacing.Many scientists have pointed out to the BBC that delaying investment simply increases the ultimate cost.And of course, the global costs of climate inaction would be much higher, as the world would be hit by increasingly damaging climate impacts.© 2023 BBC.
